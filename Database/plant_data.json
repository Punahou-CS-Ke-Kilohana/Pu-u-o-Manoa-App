        "General Information": "The hidden-petaled abutilon is a smaller relative of hibiscuses belonging to the Mallow family (Malvaceae).  There are some 150 species worldwide in the genusAbutilon.The Hawaiian Islands have four native species: one indigenousAbutilonspecies (Abutilon incanum) and three endemic endangered species (Abutilon eremitopetalum, A. menziesii, A. sandwicense).",
        "Etymology": "The generic nameAbutilonis derived from the Arabic awbūtīlūn (’abū ṭīlūn), for malvaceous (mallow-like) plants. [3, 4]The specific epitheteremitopetalumliterally means \"hidden petaled.\"Hawaiian Name:There is noknownHawaiian name for the hidden-petaled abutilon.",
        "Background Information": "The Saga of the Hidden-petaled abutilonThe  hidden-petaled abutilon was \"discovered\" by George Munro in 1930 in  Maunalei Valley, Lānaʻi. This abuliton has always been considered rare with  widely scattered populations. The grazing and antler rubbing activities  of Axis deer or chital (Axis axis), introduced to the islands in  1867, has only added to the abutilon's decline.In 1951, only two or  three plants were found. By the early 1980's this species was considered  extinct. However, in 1987 about 60-70 plants were discovered in the  north fork of Kaheʻa Gulch on a slope. But by 1990, only 30 plants were  observed by Steve Perlman (National Tropical Botanical Garden, Kauaʻi). By June  1993 the population was reduced to only seven specimens--the rest eaten  by deer. [1,2]Today, about 100 plants are found in a single wild population in Kaheʻa Gulch.Fortunately, these plants are in cultivation today and grow in several public and private gardens.",
        "Modern Use": "Abutilon eremitopetalumis closely related to koʻoloa ʻula (A. menziesii) and will readily hybridize producing an interesting cross with characteristics of both parents.Like so many other species in the Malvaceae, or Mallow Group, this species, while still uncommon in commercial landscapes, it is rather easy to grow and maintain in the home garden.",

        "Additional Landscape Use Information": "Koa are fast growing trees at 5 feet per year for the first five years, and can reach impressive heights in several decades in upper elevation landscapes. [16] Though koa can grow at lower elevations, some varieties may succumb to diseases after a decade of growth.  Since there is so much variety in koa habit from shrubby, multi-branched forms to tall straight trees, it is good to inquire of the source so as to suit your landscaping needs.While koa can grow to heights of over 100 feet in their natural  undisturbed environment, it would take many decades, if ever, to reach  such heights in the urban landscape. They are more likely to grow to  about 20 to 30 feet in the landscape at low elevations. [Rick Barboza,  Hui Kū Maoli Ola]Growth is in virtue of symbiosis with special bacteria called rhizobia that live associated with the roots.  The bacteria convert, or fix, nitrogen from the air into usable nitrogen fertilizer for plants. The leaves, flowers and branches also provide nitrogen for understory and plants in the area. Koa inoculated with rhizobia tend to be more vigorous trees. [1]Recommended planting is above 2000 feet [610 m]. [16]Koa are easily damaged by lawnmowers and gas trimmers, a.k.a. \"weed wackers.\" J. B. Friday, Extension Forester with the University of Hawaiʻi Cooperative Extension Service, comments that once koa injured, \"rot tends to set in and the trees day are numbered.\" How to prevent unnecessary injury for these fragile trees? J. B. says that \"a wide band of mulch and keep weed-eating implements away.\" [22]J. B. Friday concludes an article with encouraging words for planting koa. He states: \"Although koa may only live 5 to 20 years in urban lowland settings and never develop into the huge spreading tree seen in the forest, there is still educational value in planting this endemic tree. At schoolyard or demonstration plantings especially, generations of children will be able to see what koa [is] and develop a connection with our forests.\" [22]Companion Plants:Koa look nice when planted with other native plants such as naio, lonomea, kōlea, kōpiko, ʻiliahi, olopua, and māmaki, pilo, hāpuʻu, and palapalai.* These plants also beneift from the nitrogen-fixation by koa._____* These plants can be found on this website using the \"Browse Plants\" feature found at the top.

Periodic pruning and removal of infected twigs is a best management program for this pest. [16,22]The Acacia psyllid (Acizzia uncatoides) can greatly infest koa plantations resulting in branchy, poorly formed trees. [22]Since koa forms a symbiotic relationship with bacteria in the roots for the nitrogen-fixing process, it is recommended that pesticides not be used around the root area.Several fungi (Fusarium oxysporum,F. solani,Calonectriaspp.), root rot (Armillariaspp.Pythiumsp.), and rusts (Ateloclaudaspp.,Endoraeciumspp.) on phyllodes are known infect koa. Native rusts (e.g.,Ateloclauda digitata) may cause deformation and \"witches broom\" but are not fatal. Older trees are also attacked by a number of wood-rotting fungi. [16] There are indeed a number of pests and diseases that affect koa, but perhaps Koa wilt is one of the more serious often resulting in the death of the plant. [11]Some native mistletoes or hulumoa (Korthalsellaspp.) also parasitize koa. [16]_____* J. B. Friday, earlier mentioned, notes that \"an outbreak of the koa moth (Scotoythra paludicola) on the Big Island in 2013 reminded koa growers of the damage potentially caused by this native insect, which defoliated tens of thousands of acres of koa... Fortunately, outbreaks of the koa moth rarely occur.\" He says that \"damaged or multiple leaders or malformed brances can be pruned if caught early enough so that they can be removed by clipping. Once branches have grown enough to require a saw for removal, it is probably too late to prune them, as wounds of koa trees allow entry of wood-rotting fungi.\" [22]",

Sadly, these brilliantly colored honeycreepers are now extinct. [14]Koa varies greatly from one location to another. For this reason and others,it is important that koa, or any other native plants from nurseries, are never planted out in the wild. This will ensure genetic variability and alleviate unforeseen problems.",
        "Early Hawaiian Use": "Koa was the most valuable tree in Hawaii. [18]In general, koa wood was also used in constructing houses (hale), spears, tools, paddles (hoe), kahili handles, calabashes (ʻumeke lāʻau), ceremonial poles (hulumanu), religious ceremonies, and short surfboards. [1,3,12,13,17,18]While there were many uses for koa, it was never used for eating  receptacles because the resin, which could not be removed, would leave a  bad taste to foods. [2,18]Canoe:The prime importance of koa for early Hawaiians Early Hawaiians was making of canoes (waʻa), not only the single kinds with an outrigger,kaukahi, but even double kinds,kaulua, which consisted on two canoes lashed together with a yoke in a special way. [18]Small narrow, long, light canoes, calledkialoaorkioloa, were suitable for a single fisherman or for racing. Other smaller canoes, about 10 to 20 feet long, could accommodate six to eight men. These canoes were scarcely twelve inches at its widest and about two feet deep. [18]Waʻa peleleu,or simplyPeleleu, were long canoes or long voyages were usually 50 feet long, but some were 100 and even 150 feet long had a depth of 6 to 12, and even 15 feet, deep! Such canoes were 1 to 2 feet wide and carved from a single log. Some of these were made from the trunks of gian evergreens that had been carried by ocean currents and winds from the Pacific coasts of America. [18]Dye:The bark was used as dye to stain kapa a red color. [1]Lei:The leaves (phyllodes) were also used in lei making. [8]Medicinal:Koa leaves were placed under a pile of lau hala mats if a person had been in a sick bed for a long time. Leaves were placed on top and spread evenly over the mat to make to person comfortable.The heat that came from the body and the leaves would make the person sweat. [7,9] Someone would wipe the sweat from the person as they fell asleep. This was almost always used for patients with a fever. [7] Young children under a year old who had become weak were given a mixture of koa leaf ash and other plants and applied inside the mouth. [7,9]The bark was applied to pūhō (abscess, burst sore, ulcer), ʻalaʻala (scar, sore perhaps tuberculosis adentis), kaokao (syphilis), leprosy (maʻi lēpela), ʻeha māui (sore bruises), and haki (broken bones). [10]Religion:Koa branches were made into booths for ritual purposes, in dedication of heiau. [18]The Choosing & Making of CanoesThe process of selecting the correct tree for making a canoe (waʻa) was more than simply walking into a forest and picking out a tree to be used.Before making a canoe, the Hawaiians employed a Kahuna, or priest, to offer prayers and sacrifices to Kū, the long-bearded god of canoes makers and of war, that the work should be successful. Then, the kahuna aided the men in selecting a suitable tree in the forest. This was a laborious work to fell a tree using a stone adze. The waʻa was then roughly hewn with the same tools.If the native bird ʻelepaio (Chasiempissp.), or the native crow, ʻalalā (Corvus tropicus),* settled on the log, this was considered an ill omen, and work on it was abandoned. Another tree was selected to take its place. If all went well, there was the chant to move the felled koa:One would cry: \"Ikū mau mau!\" (Stand together!). Then from all: \"Ikūwā!\" (Shout!)One: \"Ikūmau mau! Ikūhulu hulu! Ikūlanawao!\" (Stand together! Haul with all your might! Under the mighty trees!)All: \"Ikūwā!\" (Shout!)One: \"Ikūlanawao!\" (Under the mighty trees!)All: \"Ikūwā!\" (Shout!)\"Ikūwa huki!\" (Shout! Pull!)\"Ikūwa ko!\" (Shout! Push!)\"Ikūwa a mau!\" (Shout! ...Snagged!)\"A mau kaēulu!\" (Snagged in the tree top!)\"E huki e!\" (PULL!) \"Kūlia!\" (STRIVE!) [20]Although the waʻa was made from koa, a number of other woods were used to construct and complete the project. Among them were ʻōhiʻa (Metrosiderosspp.), ʻahakea (Bobeaspp.), wiliwili (Erythrina sandwicensis), kamani (Calophyllum inophyllum), ʻulu (Artocarpus altilis), kukui (Aleurites moluccana), and hau (Hibiscustiliaceus), to name a few, with the last three being Polynesian introduced plants. [20]_____* ʻElepaio are only known to have existed on Kauaʻi, Oʻahu and Hawaiʻi Island; ʻAlalā is only known from Hawaiʻi Island. Both are still found today on these islands. While there is no fossil evidence of ʻelepaio found on other islands, there were two otherCorvusspecies found on the islands of Oʻahu and Molokaʻi at the time of early Polynesian settlers.",
        "Modern Use": "Today, koa is propagated and planted in forest restoration projects and/or used as shade trees in home gardens. [18]The wood is still very much prized in wood craft and is high in demand, being one of the most expensive woods in the world. [1,12,15]Koa is also a tonewood and used in modern musical instruments such as ʻukulele, acoustic guitars,* some electric guitars, and Weissenborn-style Hawaiian steel or lap guitars. [5,15]Dyes, or tannins, are still made from koa bark. The dye colors will range from light to very dark (blackish) browns according to the mordant (dye setting metal substance) used on the fabric.

RegardingKoaiʻe, it can figuratively mean a person or anything from the upland country. [10]Koa ʻōhahas been used for this species. Regarding this name,Hawaiian Dictionariesonline provides this explanation forʻohā: \"n. Taro corm growing from the older root, especially from the stalk  called kalo; tender plant (Isa. 53.3), shoot, sucker, branch (Isa.  11.2).Fig., offspring, youngsters (FS 235; cf.ʻohana). Also muʻu.

            "Koaiʻa usually have straighter and narrower phyllodes (expanded petioles) than koa.",
            "The seeds of koaiʻa are arranged in pods end-to-end (vertical) as opposed to a side-by-side (horizontal) arrangement with koa."
        ],
        "Early Hawaiian Use": "In general, the dense reddish brown wood is harder than koa and was used by early Hawaiians for short spears (ihe), long spears (pololū), fish lures (lāʻau melomelo), shark hooks (makau manō) with bone points, bait sticks in fishing, fancy paddles (hoe), house (hale) construction, ʻukēkē (musical bow), calabashes (ʻumeke), [5] and the ʻiʻe kūkū --the final beater to smooth out the kapa. [5,8]Koaiʻa was not used for making canoes (waʻa) because it produced curly grained wood. [9]Lei:One older source (Charles Gaudichaud,1819) states that Hawaiians \"used   all fragrant plants, all flowers and even colored fruits\" for lei   making. The red or yellow were indicative of divine and chiefly rank;   the purple flowers and fruit, or with fragrance, were associated with   divinity. Because of their long-standing place in oral tradition, the  leaves and flowers of koaiʻa were likely used for lei making by early  Hawaiians,  even though there are no written sources. [6]Medicinal:The crushed koaiʻa leaves were mixed with other plant materials and used in a steam bath for skin disorders.",
        "Modern Use": "Koaiʻa is sometimes seen in home and commecial landscapes. Hopefully, it will become a commonly used urban tree since it does so well in lower elevations.Though the wood was apparently readily available to the early Hawaiians, only later in time was it used to make furniture. [10]The phyllodes (sickle-shaped \"leaves\") are still used to make a nice lei. [6]",

[Joel Lau, Botanist]On Kauaʻi and Molokaʻi ʻiwaʻiwa can be found along the coast in sea caves.This is an uncommon to rare fern in the Hawaiian Islands and increasingly becoming scarce. It known only from one natural location on Oʻahu. But, it is a common to rare maidenhair fern found worldwide.In some parts of the U.S.A. such as Kentucky, it is threatened, and in North Carolina it is endangered. [4]",
        "General Information": "ʻIwaʻiwa (Adiantum capillus-veneris) is the only native maidenhair fern in the islands. There are, however, several other non-native species, including the more agressive Delta maidenhair (Adiantum raddianum), a naturalized species. But because the two species have different habitats, there probably not much competition between them.Other maidenhair ferns found in Hawaiʻi are four naturalized species: Rough maidenhair(Adiantum hispidulum), Brittle maindenhair or ʻiwaʻiwa hāuli* (A. tenerum) [3], Delta maidenhair (A. raddianum), and an horticultural escapee,Adiantum'Edwinii'.#_____*hāulimeans blackish or dark.# TheAdiantumcultivar 'Edwinii' is naturalized in Lānaʻi and West Maui.Adiantum'Edwinii' is probably a cultivar ofA. raddianumor possibly a hybrid or cultivar ofA. concinnum, a native of southern Mexico to northern South America.",
        "Etymology": "The generic name,adiantos, is from the Greek, unwetted, and ancient name alluding to the water-repellent fronds.The specific name,capillus-veneris,comes from the Latincapillus, hair, andvenereus, of Venus.Hawaiian Name:ʻIwaʻiwa hāwai. The wordhāwaimeans \"to purify water.\" [1]ʻIwaʻiwa kahakahameans \"stripedʻiwaʻiwa.\"",
        "Background Information": "ʻIwaʻiwa (A. capillus-veneris) can be distinguished from otherAdiantumspp. in Hawaiʻi by the fan-shaped viened fronds and pinnule (section of the frond), and by the rectangular or bar-shaped sori (spore collection) on the underside of the frond tips.",
        "Early Hawaiian Use": "The shiny dark brown to purplish black stipes (petiole or stem of the frond) were used woven inlau halamats and purses to create design. [5,10]Early Uses Outside of the Hawaiian Islands:Maidenhair fern has been used to some extent by diverse cultures around the world such as Brazil, China, Egypt, England, Haiti, India, Iraq, Lesotho, Mexico, Native Americans (Navajo, Skokomish, Cherokee, Iriquois), Peru, Spain, Turkey, U.S.A., and Venezuela. [6,7,8,9]The ancient Greeks made tea from the this fern as an expectorant for  coughs. European medieval herbalists used it for treating severe respiratory such  as for pleurisy, but it was not very effective since the fern is not a  potent herb for this medical use. [6,7,8]The 18th-century herbalist K'Eogh stated: \"It helps cure asthma, coughs, and shortness of breath. It is good against jaundice, diarrhea, spitting of blood and the biting of mad dogs. It also provokes urination and menstruation and breaks up stone in the bladder, spleen and kidneys.\" [7,9]",
        "Modern Use": "This fern is still used and prescribed by herbalists worldwide for treating coughs, bronchitis, reducing excess mucus, chronic nasal congestion, and to ease sore throats. [6]",

        "Etymology": "The genus nameAlphitoniais from the Greekalphiton, barley meal, in reference to the dry, mealy quality of the mesocarp (part of the fruit) of these plants.The species nameponderosais Latin for heavy, weighty, significant.Hawaiian Names:The namesKauilaandKauwilaare different spellings both for this species and its close relativeColubrina oppositifolia.Oʻais a Maui name for this tree.",
        "Background Information": "Kauwila wood is a beautiful reddish color with black streaks and is very hard, strong and durable. [2] One of the heaviest native woods which sinks in water.",
        "Early Hawaiian Use": "Early Hawaiians used this hard wood* for handles for stone chisels, beams for huts (pupupu hale), kapa beaters, javelins or spears, digging sticks (ʻōʻō), carrying poles, and tall straight portable poles for kāhili. [1,6,7,8]Medicinal:Both species of kauila were used medicinally for kūhewa (stroke, as of heart failure, apoplexy). [5]Music:Additionally, this species (Alphitonia pondersoa) was used to make ʻumeke, two-foot long stringed instrument. [9]Is Kauila Poisonous?Its wood was one of three kinds from trees on Mauna Loa, Molokaʻi, that   were rumored to be poisonous from that location alone, and were used in   black magic. The three trees were called kālai pāhoa; the others were   ʻohe (Polysciassp.) and nīoi (Eugeniasp.). [10]Today, we know these trees to be harmless._____* Both species of kauila or kauwila,Alphitonia ponderosaandColubrina oppositifolia, were used and also called by the same name by early Hawaiians. When the wood is freshly cut,Colubrina oppositifoliahas a yellowish sapwood and a light, reddish brown heartwood;Alphitonia pondersoahas red wood throughout with a light sapwood and a dark heartwood. Unfortunately, since both appear the same when dried the color differences fade over the years and can create confusion as to which species was used for particular carvings in some cases. [4,8]",
        "Modern Use": "The lintels above the windows of the Hawaiian Missionary Printing House, built in 1821, were made of this wood and was quite sound when removed for restoration in 1972. [8]Rounded polished rods of this wood became hairpins for women. [8]There is some limited wood working today and has been seen to be fashioned into bowls, commanding high prices. [3]",

[16]",
        "General Information": "Maile is in the same family (Apocynaceae) as the non-native plumeria. Other natve Hawaiian family members include four species of hōlei (Ochrosiaspp.), two species of kaulu (Pteralyxiaspp.), and hao (Rauvolfia sandwicensis).",

Included among these vents are the craters of Āliapaʻakai, Āliamanu, and Makalapa. [Joel Lau, Botanist]Maile is one of the more commonly encountered native plants in its natural habitat. [15] This shrub or vine is very diverse ecologically and morphologically. Though there are some 13 different forms, only one has been given formal taxonomic status. [12]",
        "Early Hawaiian Use": "Bird Catching:Other uses for maile were sticks attached to the end of the ʻaukuʻu (pole) used for catching birds (the maile was gummed with lime, and birds perching on it were caught).  [11]Maile was also the name of a snare used in catching plovers (kōlea) around the leg. [11]Clothing:Because new kapa has a strange smell, scented plants such as maile and ʻiliahi (sandalwood) were stored in large calabashes with the kapa used for clothing and bedding. [9]Games & Sports:Maile branches were also fashioned as a rod or wand used in the games of pūhenehene and ʻume. [11]Lei:Maile  was very much favored by early Hawaiians and all forms highly prized in  lei making. [2,9,13] However, of the three mainly distinct forms: maile  lau nui on Hawaiʻi Island, maile lau liʻi on Oʻahu, and maile lau  liʻiliʻi on Kauaʻi, the latter with the smallest leaves were desired the  most for lei making. [5] Several distinct forms were recognized and  named by Hawaiians. (See \"Additional Plant Texture Information\")The publicationIn Gardens of Hawaiinotes: \"Maile is used for leis for the people; for men, women, children;  for the chiefs, the noted people, and the rich people; for the farmer,  the oppressed, the branded servant...and because it was so very much  desired by the people, therefore it was greatly used in the composing of  songs, hulas, chants, dirges, and various other compositions.\" [10]Medicinal:All parts of maile were used in steam baths to rid body odor. One variety known as maile kaluhea, meaning fragrant or sweet maile, was used in a washing fluid for abscesses, hemorrhoids, and deep lacerations. [7] An infusion was made of pounded maile and other plants and used in a sweat bath for yellow blotches on skin. [8]Religion:Maile was important to Laka, the goddess of hula, and was used at her altar.",
        "Modern Use": "In earlier days, maile was used to secure an ox's neck to the yoke. [11]Maile are traditional lei plants and one of the few plants grown for commercial use as lei material. [14] In one years time, the leaves of the new growing tips can be used for lei. [Native Nursery, LLC] Lei material is best harvested early in the morning. Maile lei are always worn open and draped. The lei last from one to four days in fresh condition. [4] Similar material is imported from the Cook Islands for lei. [15]Lei maile vines are popular favorite for special occasions such as weddings, high school and college graduates, and other special occasions. [6]",

        "General Information": "Pua kala is the only poppy native to Hawaiʻi in the Poppy family (Papaveraceae) and a close relative of the Mexican poppy (Argemone mexicana), which is naturalized in the islands. A hybrid between the two species was collected at Pāʻia, Maui but did not produce seed.The two varieties ofArgemone glaucaare separated by a few differences such as the number of prickles on the capsules, with var.decipiensbeing about twice as prickly.One of the few native plants that can survive fires, pua kala has been seen to re-appear after soon after an area has been burned. [8]",
        "Etymology": "The genus nameArgemoneis derived from the Greekargema, cataract, in refernce to the use of the sap of type of poppy reputed to cure cataracts.The specific epithetglaucais from the Greek,glaukos, for blue-green or blue-gray referring to the color of this poppy's leaves.The subspecific namedecipiensis from the Latindeceptum, deceptive or misleading.Hawaiian Name:Pua kalaliterally means \"thorny flower.\" [8] This is also the name given to a native lobelia (Cyanea solenocalyx) with prickly leaves, found in gulches of Molokaʻi.The name Pōkalakala is also used forPolyscias racemosa[syn.Munroidendron racemosum].",
        "Background Information": "Pua kala is one of the few endemic plants with prickles or thorns.It is also one of the few truly toxic native Hawaiian plants (See notes under \"Limitations\"). Unlike its relative the opium poppy (Papaver somniferum), it does not, however, contain morphine or codine. [4] However, pua kala does house alkaloids that irritate the stomach and intestines. [1] But because of the extremely bitter taste there have been few reported poisonings.The acrid taste is also unpalatable to cattle. [1]Strangely, it has been considered as a \"weed\" by some in the Hawaiian Islands, even though it is an endemic plant. [6]",
        "Early Hawaiian Use": "Even with the toxic background, the early Hawaiians used the bright yellow sap (latex) and seeds medicinally for toothache pain, neuralgia (nerve pain), and ulcers. [2,4,5,7]The sap was also used for warts. [2,4,5]",
        "Modern Use": "One of the few native plants found in cow pastures. [4] Since cattle [1] and possibly other ungulates (goats, sheep) will not eat pua kala, it may be used the plants as a beautiful and natural border hedge for unwanted grazers from entering into fragile areas.",

        "Additional Habitat Information": "In the Hawaiian Islands, ʻēkaha is found as a terrestrial, epiphyte or a lithophyte (on rocks) in dry and mesic and into wetter forests from 130 to about 2500 feet [2] on all the Main Islands except Niʻihau and Kahoʻolawe. It can been seen on the lateral branches or crotch of large both native (e.g. koa) and non-native (e.g. monkey pod) trees.This beautiful fern is also native to Polynesia, tropical Asia and Australia east to Mauritius and Madagascar.",
        "General Information": "ʻĒkaha (Asplenium nidus) belongs to one of the largest of the fern families Apleniaceae or the Spleenwort family.There are 28 species ofAspleniumferns native to the Hawaiian Islands, 14 of which are endemic. [8]",
        "Etymology": "The genus nameAspleniumis from the Latinasplenum, spleenwort. Ancient Greeks believed that this fern could cure spleen diseases.The Latin specific epithetnidus, nest, in reference to the nest-like appearance of this fern.Hawaiian Name:ʻĒkaha kuahiwimeans \"mountainʻēkaha.\"",
        "Background Information": "The bird's-nest fern or ʻēkaha (Asplenium nidus) is one of the most recognizable of all ferns with its unmistakable large wide fronds visually similar to banana leaves. Another distinctive characteristic are the numerous long parallel rows of sori (fern spores) blanketing the underside of the fronds giving it a rusty look.On Oʻahu (southern Koʻolau Mts.) and on Maui in dry to mesic forests, very young ʻēkaha* is frequently seen with another indigenous fern ʻoheʻohe (Haplopteris elongata). The long narrow fronds and rhizomes of ʻoheʻohe appear to look like aerial roots coming from the accompanying ʻēkaha. It is not clear if ʻoheʻohe is growing as an epiphyte on ʻēkaha or the reverse._____* A juvenile form of ʻēkaha is called ʻēkahakaha.",
        "Early Hawaiian Use": "Household Furnishings:The dark midribs of ʻēkaha fronds were woven into lau hala mats and other objects of lau hala to provide pattern and color contrast. [6,7]Medicinal:A liquid made from ʻēkaha leaf shoots and mixed with other plants was used to treat children and infants with ʻea or thrush and pāʻaoʻao, a disease which physically weakens. [3] Shoots with other plants were pounded and liquid squeezed into mouths of children with mouth sores or general weakness. [5] An ointment was also made from the leaves and mixed with other ingredients and liquid was used for ulcers or body sores (pūhō kolokolo kokoʻole). [3,5]Other Uses:ʻĒkaha were ceremonially planted to cover residual stumps after a tree had been felled for canoe (waʻa) making and before it was shaped with an adze. [7]",
        "Modern Use": "Though a common house plant, most sold in the U.S. are notAsplenium nidusbut rather the similar lookingAsplenium australasicum. This is a great reason to acquire plants called \"bird's-nest ferns\" from reputable native plant sources.There are several nice cultivars usually based on leaf shapes, some of these being quite spectacular!",

[9]_____* Terrestrial plants are no longer able to grow on Keaoi, following the 1975 earthquake. National Park Service botanists surveyed Keaoi in the 1940s and reported finding 4 native species. Other biologists reported an absence of shrubs, indicating that the rocky substrate, wind, and salt spray allowed only low-growing vegetation to persist. Because it is now awash with waves, traditional threats to terrestrial resources are irrelevant to Keaoi. [9]",

The small buds, caperberries (immature fruits) and young shoots with leaves are pickled in vinegar or preserved with salt.

This most unwelcomed grass has copious small sharp burrs that attach themselves to unwary pets and a passerby's pants, socks, shoe laces, and exposed skin! The Hawaiian name kukū and the Latin species nameechinatusboth names refer to spines, thorns, or prickles--most apropos for this grassy \"land-urchin\" (vauna ʻāina).Of the fiveCenchrusspecies found in the Hawaiian Islands, only the critically endangeredCenchrus agrimonioidesis native.",

These may represent a distinct species. The specimens are said to be 3 or 4 feet tall.\" [3]",
        "Early Hawaiian Use": "Medicinal:Leaves were pounded with salt to treat to wounds or sores. It was also used in bathing for maʻi ʻino (venereal disease). The bitter plant was mixed with ʻuala, pia and kō (sugar) for pāʻaoʻao (childhood disease, with physical weakness), and for killing worms and naio (pinworms) in the stomach.

        "Early Hawaiian Use": "The wood is very light when dried and will burn like paper. [2] The Hawaiian name pāpala originated from a practice on Kauaʻi. Formerly on the north coast of Kauaʻi, Hawaiians most often used the flammable pāpala wood as firebrand. During times when the strong winds swept out to the sea, they would throw burning pieces from cliffs which floated along on the winds. When the fire would reach the center of the wood sparks shot out like fiery rockets in what must have been an impressive display. This sport was called ʻōahi. [1,3]",

        "General Information": "ʻĀweoweo belongs to the Amaranth family (Amaranthaceae). Of the 150 or so species ofChenopodiumor Lamb's Quarters known worldwide, the Hawaiian endemic ʻāweoweo is the woodiest in the genus developing a trunk up to a foot in diameter and the only member to attain to the status of a tree, though rarely ever reaching two meters (over 6 feet). [1,3]Familiar culinary members in the same genus include Quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa), a nutrious grain from the Andes; Huauzontle (C. nuttalliae), a Mexican vegetable prepared like spinach or broccoli; White goosefoot or Bathua (C. album), a vegetable of ancient origin and still eaten today in India; and Strawberry blite (C. capitatum), which has bright red edible flowers resembling strawberries but tasting like spinach.The native Hawaiian family members include five species ofCharpentiera, a very rare and little known amaranth (Amaranthus brownii) from Nīhoa, three species ofAchyranthes, and three species of kuluʻī (Nototrichiumspp.).",
        "Etymology": "The generic name is from the Greekchen, goose, andpous, foot, referring to the goose-like foliage.The specific epithetoahuenserefers the island of Oʻahu.Hawaiian Names:Alaweo hunais a Niʻihau name for this plant.A reputable source spells this as ʻaweoweo. [7] But for modern use, it is spelled with a kahakō over the \"a.\" [8]",
        "Background Information": "Native water and land birds (e.g. Nihoa finch), and seabirds use ʻāweoweo for food, nesting material or nesting sites. [3,4,7] This shrub along with ʻilima are the predominant plants on Nīhoa. [7]",
        "Early Hawaiian Use": "Early Hawaiians used the wood to form shark hooks (makaumano) fitted with bone points. [2]The leaves and shoots were wrapped in ti (kī) leaves, cooked in an ʻimu and eaten in times of food scarcity by early Hawaiians. This added greens and roughage to their diet. [2,5,6]Medicinally, it was used to treat children with ‘ea (thrush) and pā‘ao‘ao (a general term for ailments), sometimes mixed with other ingredients such as niu (coconut), kukui, līpoa (a brown seaweed,Dictyopterisspp.), uluhe (wawae ‘iole kuahiwi, cf.Huperziaspp. orLycopodiumspp.), ‘ala‘ula (wawae ‘iole kahakai, cf.Codium edule, a green seaweed), ‘ilima (Sida fallax), or even marine shells, and then fed to children with poi or possibly ‘uala (sweet potato). [9]TheHawaiian Ethnobotany Online Databasenotes: \"The kahuna ho‘omanamana called this plant ‘iloe holokula, because it  was used everywhere to induce death…[also used] with the ‘ākia lau nui (Wikstroemia)  and some bitter plants as firewood in the fireplaces used to send  prayers.\" [9]",

[9] However, Pukui & Elbert do not use this name for this species. [10]In modern times to help with the proper pronunciation, hāpuʻu should be spelled with a kahakō over the \"a.\" [7,8]",
        "Background Information": "Wild pigs (puaʻa) have had a severe effect on hāpuʻu populations in some areas, eating the entire starchy inner core thus destroying the plants and leaving a trough for breeding mosquitoes. [7] As long as the growing fronds or fiddles are not destroyed, the ferns can continue to grow. [9]A natural hybridCibotium chamissoixC. menziesii, namedC.xheleniaeafter fern expert Daniel A. Palmer's wife, Helen, is intermediate in character between the two parents. This hybrid occurs on most  leeward ridges and the bases of windward cliffs, Koʻolau Range and Mt. Kaʻala, Waiʻanae Range, Oʻahu. It is probably found on other islands where to the two species coexist.The pulu (\"wool\") is used as nest lining by Hawaiian honeycreepers. [7]A vernacular name used is Chamisso's tree fern. [12]",
        "Early Hawaiian Use": "ʻŌhiʻa (Metrosideros polymorpha) seedlings are often seen growing from the moist debris collected on hāpuʻu. The roots go down to the ground. Thus, some early Hawaiians believed tree ferns were the parents of ʻōhiʻa. [9]Food:Hawaiians, both long ago as well as in recent  times, ate the uncoiled fronds (fiddles), which were considered  delicious when boiled. Likely the starchy core of this species, as with  hāpuʻu pulu and hāpuʻu ʻiʻi, was used as an important famine food. [2,3]  One trunk may contain 50-70 pounds of almost pure starch and would have  been used for human consumption, while young stems were fed to pigs.  [2,12] It was prepared by peeling the young fronds or placing the entire  trunk with the starchy center in an ʻimu or in steam vents at the  volcano. [4]The saying was \"He hāpuʻu ka ʻai he ai make\" (If the hāpuʻu is the food, it is the food of death).Pulu:The pulu, the soft woolly material around the base of the fronds, was used by Hawaiians up to the mid-1800s for dressing wounds, embalming bodies,* and for pillow and mattress stuffing. [5] The outside \"skin\" of the partly uncurled fronds (pepeʻe) was used to make hats (pāpale). [12]Tall hāpuʻu were cut down to gather the pulu more easily. Since hāpuʻu trunks are basically an entire root structure in themselves, many of the hāpuʻu that were cut down usually grew back with minimal damage to forest populations._____* The embalming procedure is described by Beatrice Krauss. She writes:\"According to Degener, pulu was used for embalming dead. Corpses were first deviscerated (throat, tongue, brain, and abdominal organs); cavities resulting from this operation were then tightly stuffed with pulu, and sewed up with olona cordage. Body was then wrapped in black tapa, and allowed to remain for eight months. Then the body was placed in cave whose mouth was sealed with rock wall and/or cement-like volcanic ash, or buried in ground, with mound of stones placed over it.\" [12]",
        "Modern Use": "Young stems were formerly used to make hats.Beginnning around 1850, pulu was shipped to the mainland for mattress and pillow stuffing. By 1869, almost 623,000 pounds had been exported. But the industry ended in 1885, which stopped the harvesting of hāpuʻu in large quantities. However, around 1920 an industry was started to produce starch for laundry and cooking. Once again, an assault began on the tree fern forests. Fortunately, it was soon halted. [12]The starchy trunk core has been used for cooking and laundry and the outer fibrous part, to line or form baskets for plants.Recent use of hāpuʻu has been as orchid and anthurium growing media.Hāpuʻu (Cibotiumspp.) has been used in home and commercial landscapes for many years. As a result some fine specimens seen in older residents and commercial establishments are decades old now. A testimony to their resilience as a faithful and time-tested landscape plant.",

From 1851 to 1884, several hundred thousand pounds of pulu were collected annually from the Kīlauea region on Hawaiʻi Island and shipped to North America with a peak in 1862 of over 738,000 lbs. From 50-75 people worked at the \"Pulu Factory\" in now Hawaiʻi Volcanoes National Park, between Makaopuhi and Nāpau Crater. After 1865, the exporting decreased until finally in the 1880's superior suffing materials replaced pulu.

        "General Information": "Cibotiumbelong to the family Cibotiaceae. [8] Worldwide there are nine species ofCibotium, four of which are endemic to the Hawaiian Islands. [13]",
        "Etymology": "The generic nameCibotiumis from the Greekkibotion, diminutive ofkibotos, a box or casket, in reference to the indusium, a part of the fern blade that covers the sorus (spores).The species epithetmenziesiirefers to Archibald Menzies (1754-1842) a Scottish surgeon and naturalist, and the first to taxonomically identify the species. [5]Hawaiian Names:The Hawaiian species are best known by the namehāpuʻucollectively, though the early Hawaiians assigned names to different species.In Hawaiian,ʻiʻimeans \"short\" or \"reddish brown\" andʻiʻiʻimeans \"tiny.\"In modern times to help with the proper pronunciation, hāpuʻu should be spelled with a kahakō over the \"a.\"  [9,10]",
        "Background Information": "Wild pigs (puaʻa) have had a severe effect on hāpuʻu populations in some areas, eating the entire starchy inner core thus destroying the plants and leaving a trough for breeding mosquitoes.The Panewa Rainforest Zoo & Gardens notes that local residents sometimes mistakenly call this species \"the male tree fern,\" while hāpuʻu pulu (Cibotium glaucum) is called \"the female tree fern.\" [2] However, hāpuʻu are not separated as male or female.A natural hybridCibotium chamissoixC. menziesii, namedC.xheleniaeafter fern expert Daniel A. Palmer's wife, Helen, is intermediate in character between the two parents. This hybrid occurs on most leeward ridges and the bases of windward cliffs, Koʻolau Range and Mt. Kaʻala, Waiʻanae Range, Oʻahu. It is probably found on other islands where to the two species coexist.These grow to be the largest of the native tree ferns growing to 35 feet and having a 3-foot trunk diameter. [2]The pulu (\"wool\") is used as nest lining by Hawaiian honeycreepers. [9]A vernacular name used is Menzies' tree fern. [12]",
        "Early Hawaiian Use": "Food:Hawaiians, both long ago as well as in recent  times, ate the uncoiled fronds (fiddles), which were considered  delicious when boiled. The starchy core, though, was famine food. One  trunk may contain 50-70 pounds of almost pure starch and would have   been used for human consumption, while young stems were fed to pigs.  This was used for human as well as pig consumption. [4,12] It was  prepared by peeling the young fronds or placing the entire trunk with  the starchy center in an ʻimu or in steam vents at the volcano. [4]The saying was \"He hāpuʻu ka ʻai he ai make\" (If the hāpuʻu is the food, it is the food of death).Pulu:The pulu, the soft woolly material around the base of the fronds, was used by Hawaiians up to the mid-1800s for dressing wounds, embalming bodies,* and for pillow and mattress stuffing. [7] The outside \"skin\" of the partly uncurled fronds (pepeʻe) was used to make hats (pāpale). [12]_____* The embalming procedure is described by Beatrice Krauss. She writes:\"According to Degener, pulu was used for  embalming dead. Corpses were first deviscerated (throat, tongue, brain,  and abdominal organs); cavities resulting from this operation were then  tightly stuffed with pulu, and sewed up with olona cordage. Body was  then wrapped in black tapa, and allowed to remain for eight months. Then  the body was placed in cave whose mouth was sealed with rock wall  and/or cement-like volcanic ash, or buried in ground, with mound of  stones placed over it.\" [12]",
        "Modern Use": "Young stems were formerly used to make hats.The starchy trunk core has been used for cooking and laundry and the outer fibrous part, to line or form baskets for plants.Recent use of hāpuʻu has been as orchid and anthurium growing media.Hāpuʻu (Cibotiumspp.) have been used in home and commercial landscapes for many years. As a result some fine specimens seen in older residents and commercial establishments are decades old now. A testimony to their resilience as a faithful and time-tested landscape plant.",

Sawgrass is so dominant that  it has been referred to in the Everglades as the \"River of Grass.\" [1,2]\"Because of the sharp, saw-like serrulations on the blades, dense beds  of  sawgrass can be dangerous to attempt to navigate through (the blades   easily cut flesh).\" [1]",
        "Early Hawaiian Use": "Captain Cook's artist John Webber sketched canoes paddlers wearing gourd (ipu) masks, [3,4] as well as a closeup portrait of man wearing and ipu mask. [5] These masks were  decorated with strips of kapa that hung down to conceal the chin and giving the appearance of a beard. The masks also had a crest resembling feathers which some are quite certain was ʻuki (Cladiumspp.). This may have beenCladium jamaicenseor an another indigenous species now referred to asMachaerina angustifolia[syn. Cladiumangustifolia], or possibly the native fern pala (Marattiadouglasii). [3,4,5]Isabella Aiona Abbott notes: \"Apparently the stems were trimmed and fitted to resemble brown hair and were anchored on the inside of the gourd in some way. Given that on his first voyage Cook reached Hawaiʻi during Makahiki, it is possible that this unique headgear was part of that religious observance. Theipuwas akinolauof Lono, the god that was the focus of Makahiki, and these men wearing theipumay well have beenkahuna pule o Lono.\" [5]",

However, the berries of ʻōhā wai nui (C. arborescens)are said to be \"not so tasty.\" [6]The latex of half-ripe berries of ʻōhā wai nui (C. arborescens) were mixed with sweet potato (ʻuala) and used to restore or increase breast milk production [4,5]. The latex was also used to treat asthmatics or to treat deep puncture wounds when mixed with ʻakoko (Chamaesyce celastroidesvar.lorifolia). The flowers were fed to children suffering from pāʻaoʻao (childhood disease, with physical weaknesses). The flowers and fruits were given to babies to cure lepo paʻa (constipation). [6]Additonally, the sticky latex mix was used in pīlali, or bird lime, to snare small forest birds for feathers for cloaks, capes, helmets, lei, and kāhili. The flowers of ʻōhā wai were used to lure the victims in kia manu (bird-catching by gumming).

        "Early Hawaiian Use": "Early Hawaiians used the heavy, durable wood of kauila to make farming tools, handles for stone chisels, pegs for repairing bowls, digging sticks (ʻōʻō), carrying poles, tall poles for banners, kāhili poles (royal feather stands), netting needles or shuttles, kapa beaters and grooving tools, prepping boards for kapa (lāʻau kahi wauke), war clubs, spears and daggers, and bait sticks for fishing. [2,7,8,9]Dye:Kauila leaves and bark produce a bluish dye for kapa. [1]Games & Sports:Kauila wood was also fashioned into spears for the games of spear  throwing (ʻōʻō ihe) and spear fencing (kaka lāʻau). The only use of the  bow and arrows was for a sport called pana ʻiole (rat shoot). Though the  bow was made from an unidentified wood, the arrows were made of kō  (sugarcane) and tipped with bone or kauila wood. [1]The sport of sledding or hōlua was reserved for young men and women aliʻi. The sled runners were made from kauila. [1]Music:The wood was also crafted into musical instruments, such as hula sticks (ka lāʻau), and was the preferred wood for muscial bows called ʻūkēkē. [1,4]Medicinal:Kauila were used for kūhewa (stroke, as of heart failure, apoplexy). [5]_____* NOTE: Both species of kauila or kauwila,Alphitonia pondersoaandColubrina oppositifolia, were used and also called by the same name by early Hawaiians. When the wood is freshly cut,Colubrina oppositifoliahas a yellowish sapwood and a light, reddish brown heartwood;Alphitonia pondersoahas red wood throughout with a light sapwood and a dark heartwood. Unfortunately, since both appear the same when dried the color differences fade over the years and can create confusion as to which species was used for particular carvings in some cases. [4]",
        "Modern Use": "Kauila wood is very rare and is protected as a federally endangered species, which makes the wood  difficult to acquire for woodworking and other uses. The wood does polish to a rich reddish-brown. [9]These beautiful trees are occasionally seen in modern landscaping.",

Nevertheless, nēnē (Branta sandvicensis), or Hawaiian  goose, do eat the fruits as part of their natural diet. So then, one  might say that when kūkaenēnē is eaten by nēnē and they deposit their  kūkae, kūkaenēnē is spread throughout the nēnē habitat!Intrestingly, another name forCoprosma ernodeoidesis ʻaiakanēnē, literally meaning \"food of the nēnē.\"",

        "Early Hawaiian Use": "Early Hawaiians certainly brought kou with them as one of the canoe plants since it is such a highly esteemed wood. [5,12]They were planted as a favorite shade tree around houses and by the seashore. [9] Women would beat their kapa under kou trees. [12]Kou was considered as one of the best woods for carvings along with the native koa (Acacia koa) and milo (Thespesiapopulnea), and the Polynesian introduced kamani (Calophyllum inophyllum). [7,8,12] Kou was prized because of the beauty of the grain and ease of cutting and carving. [12]Dye:The leaves were used to stain fishing lines a light tan. [5,10,12]  The aged leaves were used for a warm brown to red dye for kapa. [1]Fishing:Wood was made into fishing hook containers. [12]Food:The tasteless seeds were eaten in times of famine or occasionally by hungry children.Household Furnishings:Wooden food bowls (ʻumeke kou), meat dishes, cups, platters (pā kou), and calabashes were highly prized as the best of all woods because it did not impart a resinous flavor to the food such as koa and most other native woods. [2,4,8,10]Lei:The flowers were used for lei and young girls especially were fond of lei kou. [4,9,12] They were always strung kui style (one behind the other). [10]Medicinal:Use to treat ʻea (thrush), a disease of young children. [12]Religion:Kou wood was fashioned into images of gods. [12]",
        "Modern Use": "The wood is used to carve artifacts such as calabashes, dishes, cups, bowls, paddles, furniture, and drums. [5,11]Uses Outside of Hawaiʻi:In Tahiti, fruit of banyan (Ficussp.) is added to kou leaves to make a beutiful red dye. [12]",

        "Early Hawaiian Use": "Agriculture:One of the few indigenous plants cultivated by early Hawaiians.Cordage:The  stems of of ʻahuʻawa were pounded until there were only fibers. The  fibers were soaked for a few hours to free pulp, dried in the sun for a  day or two, and then could be used. [7] The material was very durable,  lasting two years or more. Two- or three-ply cordage was used for cords  (hāwele) or nets (kōkō puʻupuʻu) designed to carry ʻumeke (food or water  containers). Due to its strength, it was good for deep water fishing  line and canoe rigging. They were also used as strainers for ʻawa or niu  (coconut) drink and medicine. [4,6,7]Lei:The leaves and seed/fruit were used in lei. [5]Medicinal:ʻAhuʻawa was used to treat ‘ea (thrush) in children. The stems and flowers were used with green kukui (Aleurites moluccana) fruit sap. ‘Ahu‘awa was also used with ‘alaea clay, ‘awa root (Piper methysticum), and kō kea (white sugar cane)  for ule hilo (gonorrhea) and waikī (gonorrhea in males). The fine sediment of ahu‘awa was mixed  with lama kuahiwi (Diospyrosspp.) for use on deep cuts, bruises, boils, cold sores. A  runny nose is treated by inhaling powdered ‘ahu‘awa. [8]Other Uses:The stringy fibers were also made into brushes to paint color onto tapa (kapa). [4]",

In the Northwest Islands, it is found only on Laysan (Kauō) where it makes up an important a part of the habitat in and around the 100-acre hyper saline lake in the center of the island. Here this sedge provides a habitat for the endangered Laysan duck and Laysan finch.On Niʻihau sheep nearly exterminated the plants until protective barriers were installed around the shore of Halāliʻi Lake where the plants were found. [2] According to one source \"Makaloa still grows at Lake Lalulu, Linakauhane, Kalanei [Kalānei] and Papataale.\" [9, brackets are Native Plants Hawaiʻi]",
        "General Information": "There are fourteen species in the genusCyperusthat are native to the Hawaiian Archipelago, with eight that are endemic, or found exclusively, here.Cyperusbelong to the Sedge Family (Cyperaceae) consisting of some 4,000 species in about 70 genera.Famous, or infamous, non-native relatives include papyrus (Cyperus papyrus), the source of the Egyptian writing material and the origin of the English word paper; piripiri or cañita (Cyperus giganteus) used in parts of Mexico for plaiting sleeping mats and sambreros; and the ever-present noxtious lawn weed nutsedge or \"nutgrass\" (Cyperus rotundus) that keep homeowners busy and gardeners employed, but also used in Kampō (traditional Japanese/Chinese medicine). [4]",
        "Etymology": "The generic name Cyperus comes from thekyperos, the Greek word for sedge.The specific epithetlaevigatusmeans smooth in Latin, in reference to the smooth stems of this rush, as the  common name Smooth flatsedge suggests.Hawaiian Name:The name makaloa was used on Niʻihau, whereas on the other islands it is called ehuʻawa. [2]The name Ehuʻawa for this species should not be confused with ʻEhuʻawa (Cyperus javanicus), which has ʻokina before the \"E.\"Makaloais \"a general name for shellfish with long sharp edges (e.g.Thais intermedia, Drupa morum).\" [13]Makaloaalso means \"very green, as a fruit,\" but not clear if this meaning has a relationship with this sedge. [5]",
        "Background Information": "Makaloa is an essential plant for our native damselflies or pinao ʻula (Megalagrionspp). Pinao ʻula need to rest and observe its surroundings for predators and/or prey, makaloa provides the perfect plant to do this. As pinao ʻula rest on the stems, or leaf blades, its eyes are perfectly designed to see either side and around the makaloa stems or leaf blades. [7]",
        "Early Hawaiian Use": "Agriculture:Early Hawaiians cultivated makaloa to some degree. Since other plants  crowded it out, barrels or cylindrical containers were placed around the  clumps to encourage longer stems for use.Clothing:Since wauke, used for tapa (kapa) was apparently not grown, or very  limited, on Niʻihau, the makaloa mats were used for making clothing, such as  pāʻū (women's skirts), loincloth (malo), capes (kīhei), and cloaks  (koloka).The finest makaloa mat at the Bishop Museum is 10.5 x 20 feet, with 25  stems per per inch and worn as a cloak by Kemehameha the Great  (Kamehameha I). [10] Incidentally, Kamehameha's full Hawaiian name is  Kalani Paiʻea Wohi o Kaleikini Kealiʻikui Kamehameha o ʻIolani i  Kaiwikapu kaui Ka Liholiho Kūnuiākea. [11]Cordage:Stem fibers were woven into string or rope. [6,9]Mats:Makaloa is found elsewhere in Polynesia, but only early Hawaiians used them to plait mats. Though makaloa mats were primarily  made on Niʻihau and Kauaʻi, they  were occasionally made on other islands as well. Mats from Niʻihau and Kauaʻi were considered to be the finest in all of Polynesia.  [1,8,9,12]Stems were used whole,  usually not not split, for even finer mats. [5,10,12] The upper yellowish  and the lower reddish parts were used with the shiny side out. [10,12] Makaloa stems were woven into beautiful decorated mats, or moena pāwehe, only by women.  Young plants made the finest mats. [10] TheTreasury of Hawaiian Words in One Hundred and One Categoriesstates that \"young plants yielded the best stems for such plaiting.\" [14]Mats were also woven for sails on canoes (waʻa), and for floor and mattress covers (uhi pela). [2,9,10]Another sedge, or rush, kohekohe (Eleocharis obtusa,E. erythropoda) was used to weave design patterns in makaloa mats.  (SeeEleocharis erythropoda, \"Special Notes and Information\")Medicinal:Fibers also used to remove impurities form medicinal liquid. [6,9]Stalks were crushed to a fine powder and used to treat deep cuts, boils, skin ulcers and other skin disorders or taken as a snuff for head colds. Flower and stalk ashes mixed with kukui nut juice was rubbed on tongue for general debility. Crushed stalks mixed with water and clay was used to treat burning in male genitals. [6]",
        "Modern Use": "Today, makaloa stems are still used to make hats, mats and baskets. One publication notes that \"the sedge is woven in elaborate patterns with as many as 30 strands in an inch.\" [3]On Molokaʻi, makaloa is used to treat wastewater. [3]",

The two subspecies had \"disjunct populations in the central portion\" of the range and came together around Waikāne. These \"intergrades between the two subspecies\" were referred to as the intermediate \"var.waikaneensis,\" but more resembled the subsp.subcordataso as not to warrant a distinct varietal status. [1]The subspeciessubcordataflowered from early May through mid-October; fruiting June through October in the souhthern Koʻolau Mts. [1]The subspeciesobtusifoliaflowered and fruited in October in the central Koʻolau Mts. [1]Interestingly, subsp.subcordatawas once cultivated on Tantalus, Oʻahu at botanist George C.

Then, in Xanthorrhoeaceae. NowDianellais placed in Asphodelaceae.  Will this charming species finally find it's home with a good family?  Stay tuned...only time and taxonomists will tell.ʻUkiʻuki (D. sandwicensis) is the sole family representative native to the Hawaiian Islands.It is possible that there are more than one species native to the islands.  There are, indeed, three separate forms known: Dianella lavarum (pictured above), D. multipedicellata and D. sandwicensis.",
        "Etymology": "The generic nameDianellais from the Roman deity Diana (lit., divine), goddess of chastity, hunting, and the moon, and the Latinellais diminutive or small.The species namesandwicensisrefers to the \"Sandwich Islands,\" as the Hawaiian Islands were once called, and named by James Cook on one of his voyages in the 1770's. James Cook named the islands after John Montagu (The fourth Earl of Sandwich) for supporting Cook's voyages.Hawaiian Names:ʻUkiis also a name used for several native sedges.",
        "Early Hawaiian Use": "Cordage:The leaves were also braided into cordage. [1,2,5]Dye:Juice extract used as pale to purple-blue dye when mixed with lime for kapa. [1,2,5]House Construction:The leaves were used for hale (house) thatching. [1,2,5]Lei:The fruit was used for seed lei. [1,2,4,5,6*]_____*[6] Uses the term \"seedlei\" in this particular reference may refer the fruit itself, since the context of the sentence also says \"the dark purple berries of ʻukiʻuki (Dianella sandwicensis)....\" The term \"seed lei\" usually refers to a lei with seeds strung for permanent lei, such as with wiliwili, lonomea, or kukui.",
        "Modern Use": "Today, ʻukiʻuki fruit is still used as a natural dye for kapa and other cloths.The blue berries can be eaten and are said to 'kind of taste like a catcus plant or a dragonfruit. Not a whole lot of flavor.' [Ed Kenney, host of \"Family Ingredients\", S2, Ep6]",

[1] Lama lama means torch, which were used at night for fishing.Food:The edible fruit called piʻoi were eaten [4].Medicinal:Lama wood was used as medicine. Huts (pupupu  hale) were made in a single day of the wood during the daylight (lama)  hours and the sick were placed inside them for curing. [6,9]Religion:Inside a hālau hula was an altar (kuahu) on which a block of lama (Diospyros sandwicensis) was placed. The wood represented the goddess of hula, Laka. [6,9]",

        "Additional Habitat Information": "Lama can be a principal or minor part of the dry and mesic forests, and sometimes in wet forests from about 15 to 4000 feet on all of the main islands, except Niʻihau and Kahoʻolawe. On the island of Hawaiʻi, lama can be found growing in open lava fields.",
        "General Information": "Lama belong to a family consisting of 450-500 species in the genusDiospyros. [3]The two native species are lama or ēlama areDiospyros sandwicensis, native to most of the main islands, andD. hillebrandiifound on Kauaʻi and Oʻahu.Some of the notable family members include species prized for their beautiful wood such as the pure black wood of the Ceylon ebony (Diospyros ebenum) and the striped ebony or Makassar (D. celebica). Other relatives have edible fruit such as the deliciously sweet Japanese persimmon or kaki (D. kaki), and the highly nutritious American persimmon (D. virginiana). [3]",
        "Etymology": "The generic nameDiospyrosis derived from the Greek,dios, god (Jove, Zeus, Jupiter), andpyros, grain in reference to the edible fruit in some species.The species namesandwicensisrefers to the \"Sandwich Islands,\" as the Hawaiian Islands were once called, and named by James Cook on one of his voyages in the 1770's. James Cook named the islands after John Montagu (The fourth Earl of Sandwich) for supporting Cook's voyages.Hawaiian Names:Lamameans “light” or “enlightenment.\"  [1] How apropos that the Kapiʻolani Community College Library (Oʻahu)  building is calledLama.A modern-day section of Honolulu, a school, and a canal are all named Kapālama, means \"thelamawood enclosure,\" where high chiefs were protected. Pālama, a street and another section of Honolulu, means \"lamawood enclosure.\" [5]",
        "Early Hawaiian Use": "The wood was used for the framework of houses, temple construction, and handles for stone chisels. [2,6,9]Fishing:Lama sticks (ʻaukā) to strengthen large one-way-in-no-way-out fish  traps. [1] Lama lama means torch, which were used at night for fishing.Food:The edible fruit of lama, called piʻoi, were eaten by early Hawaiians. [4]Medicinal:Lama wood was used as medicine. Huts (pupupu hale) were made in a single day of the wood during the daylight (lama) hours and the sick were placed inside them for curing. [6,9]Religion:Inside a hālau hula was an altar (kuahu) on which a block of lama (Diospyros sandwicensis) was placed. The wood represented the goddess of hula, Laka. [6,9]",
        "Modern Use": "The semi-sweet fruit is enjoyed by hikers and backpackers today.The beautiful dark wood is occasionally used in modern wood working today. [8]",

        "General Information": "The genusDodonaeabelongs to the Soapberry family (Sapindaceae) with some 70 species, 61 of which occur in Australia with 59 endemic species.Dodonaea viscosais the only Pantropic species and found tropical, subtropical and warm temperate regions of United States (California, Arizona, Florida) to South America, Africa, southern Asia, Papua New Guinea, Australia, New Zealand, and some Pacific islands, including the Hawaiian Islands.Other native Hawaiian members include two endemics māhoe (Alectryon macrococcus), and lonomea (Sapindusoahuensis), and the indigenous mānele (Sapindussaponaria).",
        "Etymology": "The generic nameDodonaeais named after the Flemish physician and botanist Rembert Dodoens (1517-1585), who was later a professor of medicine at Leiden, The Netherlands.The specific epithetviscosais derived from viscous or sticky.Hawaiians Names:ʻAʻaliʻi kū ma kua(meaning ʻaʻaliʻi standing in back),ʻaʻaliʻi kū makani(ʻaʻaliʻi standing in the wind), andkūmakani(windbreak or wind resisting).",
        "Background Information": "ʻAʻaliʻi is an extremely variable plant with many habit, leaf and capsule forms and colors. One can hardly say that there is a typical ʻaʻaliʻi. Three intergradingDodonaeaentities may be recognized in the Hawaiian Islands, possibly to a species level:(1)D. sandwicensis, found occuring in wet motane sites, have mostly 2-winged capsules. [7] This plant is the only one of the three found in wet areas. Apparently endemic to the Hawaiian Islands. [Joel Lau, Botanist](2)D. viscosa[syn.D. angustifolia,D. eriocarpa,D. spaulata], widespread and pan-tropic but in the Hawaiian Islands this plant is primarily found in open, mesic to dry sites on all the Main Islands. These plants have 3-4-winged capsules that are fuzzy and turgid (swollen). [6](3)D. stenoptera, which occur primarily on Molokaʻi and scattered sites on Oʻahu (tree-sized), have the largest capsules of the three species and are strongly inflated, 4-winged and wings are short, almost wingless. Apparently these plants are/were found on Lānaʻi and West Maui (two records). [Joel Lau, Botanist]This is a favorite food plant for the Blackburn butterly (Udara blackburni) caterpillars, one of two endemic Hawaiian butterflies, as well as the striking gem-like koa bug (Coleotichus blackburniae). [8]The seeds were a food source for the Hopue or Greater koa-finch (Rhodacanthus palmeri). This beautiful bright orange and green honeycreeper was a native of the koa forests of the Kona and Kaʻū districts of Hawaiʻi Island, but is now extinct. [12]ʻAʻaliʻi is one of the few native Hawaiian plants that can endure fires and is a pioneer plant, that is, seeds survive and plants will return to the burned areas. [8]",
        "Early Hawaiian Use": "Early Hawaiians had many uses for ʻaʻliʻi. The yellowish-brown hard wood, sometimes with black  heartwood, was used for canoe building, weapons, agricultural tools,  rafters, posts and thatching posts or purlins in house (hale)  construction. [1,8,10,11,13]Regarding the resiliency of these tough shrubs, an ancient boasts of the people of Kaʻū states: \"He ʻaʻaliʻi au; ʻaʻohe  makani e hina ai\" which means \"I am an ʻaʻaliʻi shrub; no wind can push  me over,\" or in other words, \"I can hold my own even in the face of  difficulties.\" [2,3,9]Dye:The seeds were boiled to make red dye for decorating kapa (tapa) cloth. [1,10]Fishing:The  very hard, durable wood is heavy and sinks in water and so was used for  bait sticks. From a canoe, the bait sticks were lowered into water at a  depth or twenty or so feet to attract fish or heʻe (octopus), which  then could be lured to the surface and caught with a waiting net.  ʻAʻaliʻi was also fashioned into light fishing spears, especially for  heʻe. [1,8,13]Lei:Fruits (capsules) and leaves were used in lei making by early Hawaiians. [1,4,9]Medicinal:The crushed leaves were used as a topical medicine for relief from irritating rashes and contagious diseases such as ringworm or \"haole rot\" and staff infections. [2,5,8,10]Like hops, flowers were used to impart a bitter flavor, and also used as a tonic. [13]For a treatment called holoina, ‘a‘ali‘i leaves are mixed with ala‘a (Planchonella sandwicensis) bark and puakala ku kula (Argemone glauca) root then ground and strained. The liquid is heated in a steam bath, which is followed with a purge of ground pilikai (Stictocardia tiliifolia) fruit to treat skin rash (‘ōhune or mane‘o). [15]",
        "Modern Use": "Capsules and leaves are still used in lei making as they were with early Hawaiians. [4,9]Used in modern times throughout the world as a poultice or decocted fortopical use only. This plant is mildly toxic containing small amounts of cyanogenic toxins and plant materials can cause cyanide poisoning if ingested. [8]ʻAʻaliʻi wood is repotedly termite resistant. [8]The cultivar 'Purpurea,' with purple foliage, is widely used as a shrub on the mainland USA.Use Outside of the Hawaiian Islands:It would not be possible to list all the cultural uses of this plant here. But some examples of the diverse uses are noted below.The wood has been used by many cultures for tool handles, walking sticks, and carving implements. The wood is also good for firewood as it ignites easily. [14]New Zealand's Māori used the wood to fashion clubs and other weapons. The Māori nameakeakemeans \"forever and ever.\"Seri, an indigenous people of Sonora, Mexico, use the plants medicinally.On New Guinea, the Yali highlanders use the wood for house construction and firewood, and apply heated leaves as plasters for wounds. [17]The wood is also used for house construction in Southeast Asia, West Africa, and Brazil. [17]",

On Oʻahu it was collected early in the last century, and is currently very rare or now extinct.More recently,Eleocharis erythropodahas been seen on Kahoʻolawe at Lua Keālialalo (Lua ʻO Keālialalo), a wetland crater in western part of the island.Apparently this species tolerates severe drought conditions in their habitat on Niʻihau. Botanist Harold St. James writes: \"Flood waters make a lake that may last for several months, then for the remainder of the year the spot is parched and completely dry and alkaline.\" He adds that the plants are \"visible there for a few months after heavy southerly winter rains.\" [7]",
        "General Information": "The 120 or more species of spikerushes (Eleocharisspp.) belong to the Sedge family or Cyperaceae. Kohekohe are generally water loving plants with some growing in mesic  environments. The Hawaiian Islands have one, possibly two, indigenous  species and at least four naturalized species.Perhaps the most well known of the spikerushes is the Chinese water chestnut (Eleocharis dulcis) in which the tubers on the rhizomes are either cooked or eaten raw.Rush or Sedge? Though rushes and sedge belong to the same family (Cyperaceae), there is a simple way to distinguish one from another: the stem-like leaves (culms). Rushes have round, cylindrical stems or leaves, sometimes hollow like a drinking straw if cut open. Sedges have triangular, often sharp-edged leaves. Just remember: \"rushes are round; sedges have edges.\"",
        "Etymology": "The genus nameEleochariscomes from  Greekhelos, \"of the  marsh or meadow,\" andcharis,  \"grace, favor, or loveliness.\"The specific epitheterythropodais from the Greekerythros, red, andpousorpodo, foot, in reference to the red basal sheaths of these plants.It is interesting to note that this plant was collected and recorded as \"E. calvavar.australis\" and considered an endemic variety by Harold St. John. [7]This species was thus previously known in Hawaiʻi asEleocharis calva.  The specific epithet, however, is an invalid name because it has been  previously used for a different species and should correctly go by the  nameEleocharis erythropoda. [2]",
        "Background Information": "Eleocharis erythropodais questionably indigenous and possibly introduced. This status is based on the botanist Harold St. John's review of the species. [7]",
        "Early Hawaiian Use": "Mats:Around each kohekohe stem is a bright reddish basal sheath. Early Hawaiians used these basal sheaths (cylinders) to make ornamental designs in makaloa mats called moena pāwale. [1,5] SinceEleochariserythropodawas the only known kohekohe to exist on Niʻihau, it is likely that this species was used in the making mats and other forms of weaving. [5,6]Medicinal:Kohekohe (Eleocharisspp.) was used to treat puʻupuʻu wela (meaning unknown?), pūhō (abscess, burst sore, ulcer), and ʻaʻai (spreading sores). The plants was processed by cooking it and then used to wash affected areas. [4]",

James Cook named the islands after John Montagu (The fourth Earl of Sandwich) for supporting Cook's voyages.Hawaiian Name:Wiliis to twist, screw or wind.Wiliwilimeans twist-twist or repeatedly twisted referring to the seed pods that twist to expose brightly colored seeds.",
        "Background Information": "These are large trees with a yellow somewhat spiny trunk.",
        "Early Hawaiian Use": "Earlier Hawaiians believed that when wiliwili were flowering along the coast, sharks were most likely to bite. [8,10]Canoe:Wiliwili, or hau (Hibiscus tiliaceus), was typically used on canoes for the outrigger float (ama). [2,11,12,13,16]Fishing:Because the wood was light, it was used for fishing gear containers and would float if a canoe (waʻa) was upset. The wood was also used for net floats. [2,11,12,13]Lei:The seeds were used by early Hawaiians to make permanent lei and the flowers for temporary lei. [5,7,11,13]Medicinal:Flowers were used for venereal diseases and pounded bark for various genital diseases. [9,10]Surfing:The  lightweight wiliwili wood was the preferred choice for surfboards (papa  heʻe nalu), either long boards (alaia) or short boards (olo). [13]  Since larger trees may have been difficult to find to be suitable for  the surfboards, they were probably reserved for the nobility, including  the chiefs. [1]",
        "Modern Use": "Today, seeds and flowers are still used to make beautiful lei. [5,7]",

[David Eickhoff, Native Plants Hawaiʻi]There are from 1 to 3 or 4, rarely 5, mature seeds per fruit. [David Eickhoff, Native Plants Hawaiʻi]Non-native birds, such as Red-vented and Red-whiskered bulbuls (Pycnontusspp.), relish nīoi. So, keep a close eye on the fruits as they ripen if you plan to collect nīoi seed by protecting them from these birds. Bird netting works good. It has also been observed that bulbuls often eat the fruits on site, dropping the seeds to the ground. Look for clean tannish-white pea-sized or split pea-shaped seeds in the debris beneath the nīoi.

A number of ʻakoko are either vulnerable, rare or endangered, with two considered extinct. Several have beautiful foliage and range in size from very prostrate sub-shrubs such asChamaesyce degeneritoChamaesyce olowaluana,which are nearly 30-foot trees--perhaps the tallest in the entire genus of 250 species worldwide!The two other native members in Euphorbiaceae are poʻolā (Claoxylon sandwicense) and a native tree euphorbia (Euphorbia haeleeleana). Some well known non-native relatives are the Castor oil plant (Ricinus communis), kukui (Aleurites moluccana), poinsettia (Euphorbia pulcherrima), cassava (Manihotesculenta),and the Para rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis)from which latex comes.Leaves of some species turn red when the plant is overly stressed. The name ʻakoko comes from the Hawaiian word \"koko\" for blood. They get their name from the red, or blood-colored, seed capsules appearing as drops of blood on the plant. [1]This ʻakoko (Chamaesyce celastroides) is the by far the most variable and widespread of all the HawaiianChamaesyce. The erect capsules (fruits) distinguish them from other species, exceptC. herbstiiandC. rockii, which have distinctively larger fruits.",
        "Etymology": "Name is derived from the Greekchamai, on the ground, andsykon, fig, perhaps in reference to the low habit of most species and the fig-like apperance of the capsules.",
        "Early Hawaiian Use": "A latex from ʻakoko (Chamaesyce celastroidesvar.lorifolia) mixed with 'ōhā (Clermontiaspp.) was used to treat asthmatics or deep puncture wounds. [3,4]Additionally, the sticky latex was used in pīlali, or bird lime, to snare small forest birds for feathers for cloaks, capes, helmets, lei, and kāhili. The flowers of ʻōhā wai were used to lure the victims in kia manu (bird-catching). [1]",

[2]One reference source spells it asʻākoko. [5] But the name is actually spelled without a kahakō over the \"a.\" [8]",
        "Background Information": "This ʻakoko (Chamaesyce celastroides) is the by far the most variable and widespread of all the HawaiianChamaesyce. The erect capsules (fruits) distinguish them from other species, exceptC. herbstiiandC. rockii, which have distinctively larger fruits.George C. Munro (1866-1963), botanist and ornithologist, notes in his journals that Lānaʻi once had a unique forest of these treelike ʻakoko was reduced to but a few struggling trees due to uncontrolled eating habits of free range domesticated goats or intentionally burned for charcoal. He notes the following in his journals: \"Within the living memory of three persons when I was on Lānaʻi, ...the plain below Lānaʻi City, the Miki lands, and throughout the Pālāwai Basin, all now growing pineapples, composed of a continous forest of this variety of this species ofEuphorbiaknown to the natives as ʻakoko.\" Munro continues: \"Awili Shaw, Naimu, and Henry Gibson, who were all brought up on Lānaʻi, could remember when theʻakokoforest was intact.\" [1]ʻAkoko(Chamaesyce celastroidesvar.lorifolia) is important for native animal and plant species. Hawaiʻi's only native bees (Hylaeusspp.) use this species as a important food and nesting source. An extinct honeycreeper, the Lānaʻi hookbill (Dysmorodrepanis munroi), searched  for small snails among foliage of ōpuhe (Urera glabra) and perhaps this species ofʻakoko. [1,5,6]It is difficult to believe that these magnificent trees are related to the ubiquitous, pesky weed spurges ever present in our yards. Far from being weedy, however, these rare spurges are in real danger of disappearing altogether.",
        "Early Hawaiian Use": "The wood of this ʻakoko was used as firewood, the leaves medicinally, and the latex used as an ingredient in canoe paint. [7]",
        "Modern Use": "Early botanists Joseph Rock and George Munro both relate of experiments conducted with the latex from this ʻakoko (Chamaesyce celastroidesvar.lorifolia). [3] Rock states: \"However, even if the rubber were not of superior grade, the amount of resin in the latex and the easy harvesting possible on Lānaʻi might have made it profitable.\" [1,3]A similar event took place on Hawaiʻi Island on Puʻu Waʻawaʻa, North Kona with another tree ʻakoko (Chamaesyce olowaluana). [4]Today, though the vast ʻakoko forests are gone, a few trees still remain on Lānaʻi and Maui, but now a faint reminder of times past.Because of this and other reasons both of the above ʻakoko have now placed in the Vulnerable status.",

[1]After flowering, tiny fruiting capsules are formed. Upon ripening the capsules split and explosively cast (dehiscent) the tiny seeds abroad. They easily germinate under moist and partial sun conditions. The seedlings can at first be mistaken for some of the taller weedy spurges that plague many urban yards. But before pulling up the \"weed,\" take the time to identify the difference between an ubiquitous spurge and a very rare ʻakoko. [David Eickhoff, Native Plants Hawaiʻi]",

A number ofʻakokoare either vulnerable, rare or endangered, with two considered  extinct.  Several have beautiful foliage and range in size from very  prostrate  sub-shrubs such asEuphorbiadegeneritoEuphorbiaolowaluana,which are nearly 30-foot trees--perhaps the tallest in the entire genus of 250 species worldwide!Another native member in Euphorbiaceae ispoʻolā(Claoxylon sandwicense). Some well known non-native relatives are the Castor oil plant (Ricinus communis),kukui(Aleurites moluccana), poinsettia (Euphorbia pulcherrima), cassava (Manihotesculenta),and the Pará rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis)from which latex comes.",

(C.E.).The specific epithetskottsbergii,is named for Prof. Carl Johan Fredrik Skottsberg (1880-1963), a Swedish explorer and plant collector in the Hawaiian Islands and elsewhere.Hawaiian Names:The nameʻakokocomes from the Hawaiian wordkokofor blood.

        "General Information": "ʻIeʻie (Freycinetia arborea) belongs to the Screw pine family (Pandanaceae) with about 180 species in the genusFreycinetiathroughout Asia, Malesia, the Pacific islands, Australia (Queensland), Norfolk Island, and New Zealand.The only other native relative in the islands, also indigenous, is hala (Pandanus tectorius).",

        "Background Information": "ʻIeʻie fruit and flowers are a favorite food of the endangered Hawaiian crow or ʻAlalā (Corvus hawaiiensis). [9,11] The honeycreeper, ʻŌʻū (Psittirostra psittacea), has a specialized bill for extracting and eating the fruits whole. These birds were important for the plant pollination and seed dispersal in the past, but are now very rare or possibly extinct. [9,11,18] Other honeycreepers, such as the extinct ʻakialoa's (Hemignathusspp.) and Greater ʻamakihi (H. sagittirosris) probed the sheathed leaf bases with their long tongues for insects. [18,19]Presently, one of the primary pollinators appears to be the alien bird Mejiro or Japanese white-eye (Zosterops japonicus) introduced to the Hawaiian Islands in 1929 to Oʻahu and 1937 to Hawaiʻi Island. [6,9]",
        "Early Hawaiian Use": "Fiber from ʻIeʻie Roots:The aerial roots of ʻieʻie were used to make many useful items by early Hawaiians. After the roots were gathered, perhaps stripped on the bark, and then baked in an earth oven (imu) to soften them before use. If not used immediately, the root fiber were dried, coiled, and stored for future use. When needed, they were soaked in water and plaited into baskets or other objects upon which the material would set up again in the characteristic brittle wicker state.The durable twined baskets (hīnaʻi), usually with lids, were the finest in the Hawaiian Islands and all of Polynesia! [16] Somtimes narrow bands of black dyed ʻieʻie straps were added for contrast with the undyed reddish brown fibers. [3,4,14] The strong root fibers were also fashioned into fish traps (hīnaʻi hoʻoluʻuluʻu), fish-carrying baskets (hīnaʻi hoʻomoem iʻa), gourd (ipu) wrapper for poi storage, to protect ipu containers, [17] idols, cordage, musical instruments [2,3,14,16] such as handle wrapping for ʻulīʻulī (ipu rattles), [17] for sandals, and for tying thatch on house roofs. Women also made traps for shrimp in streams. [21] Additionally, the fibers were used as the framework for wicker helmets (mahiole), feathered helmets (haka), feathered cloaks, and kāhili. [7,8,12,14,15,16]Lei:The beautiful orange-yellow bracts were used for lei. [1]Medicinal:Shoots and leaves laid over sheets in bed for severe body pain. The shoots were pounded with other plants, squeezed, and the juice giving to strengthen children with general debility. The stems were pounded with other plants, squeezed, and the juice taken for menstrual problems. [13] A tea was boiled to help a woman after birth to stop blood flow. [20]Religion:ʻIeʻie  branches were one of only five plants placed on hālau hula altars. [3,5]",
        "Modern Use": "As common as ʻieʻie is seen in the wild, it is not seen much in cultivation, even at botanical gardens. It is hoped that this spectacular plant will one day be seen as a common part of Hawaiian landscapes.",

        "Etymology": "The generic name Gossypium is derived from the Greek name for cotton,gossypion.The specific epithettomentosumfrom the Latintomentosusor tomentose, meaning \"covered with tangled or matted, woolly hairs.\"Hawaiian Name:The namemaʻocomes from the Hawaiian wordʻōmaʻofor green and shares the same name as the native Hawaiian thrush,ʻōmaʻo(Myadestes obscurus) which has a greenish cast to its feathers.",
        "Background Information": "It is unfortunate that some have considered maʻo as a \"weed\" when it is certainly not a common species in many natural areas in the Hawaiian Islands. [7]",
        "Early Hawaiian Use": "Dye:The early Hawaiians used the leaves for a light green (ʻōmaʻomaʻo) or a rich red-brown dye. [2,8] Isabella Abbott notes that \"any greenkapadeserves close scrutiny, too, for the green obtained frommaʻoleaves is fleeting, fading within a few days. The Bishop Museum collection contains nokapathat has retained its green coloration, but a few pieces may once have been green, judging by their overall design.\" [9]The flower petals also produced a yellow dye. [2]Food:The flowers were sun dried and eaten. Other plant parts were made into a liquid for consumption. [5]Lei:Maʻo flowers were used in lei making. [8]Medicinal:Apparently, the fibers were also used for medicinal applications much as a cotton swab would be used today. [3] For severe stomach cramps, the dried flowers were eaten along with other plants while also drinking a tea made with maʻo bark and other plants. [6] The flowers and bark of tap roots mixed with other ingredients were used to treat gripping stomach aches, such as during childbirth. [5]Other Uses:Although the fibers were once used by early Hawaiians for stuffing pillows, it was not used as a fabric. [3]",
        "Modern Use": "There is so much to learn about our flora. The following example of maʻo underscores the value of saving our native plants.Breeding maʻo an with other closely related species is possible. The native Hawaiian cotton, or maʻo, helped to save the cotton industry  in modern times. When maʻo is crossed with other cotton strains, the  resulting commercial hybrids are less attractive to insect pests that  destroy cotton crops.Cotton  for cloth manufacturing is obtained from the fuzzy seed coating found in  the fruit or capsules. Four species are used commercially cotton  species with the Upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) generating about 90% of industry use, and American Pima or Sea island cotton (G. barbadense) with 8%--both naturalized species in Hawaiʻi. The remaining 2% between two other species (G. arboreum, G. herbaceum). [4]A commercial cotton industry was started in Kailua, Hawaiʻi Island in 1838 and lasted for about a century, but never became an important trade.Additionally, there is interest in other agronomic traits of maʻo, such as natural brown lint and heat tolerance. [11]Though this beautiful shrub has declined in many areas, there have been some successful restoration stories as well. Alex Lehman, University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa, notes one of these on Oʻahu: \"When off-roading near Makapuʻu lighthouse was halted, the maʻo population made a dramatic resurgence. Today, if you walk the trails between Sandy Beach and Makapuʻu in the springtime you will be greeted by hundreds of flowering maʻo hidden amongst the koa haole and buffel grass.\" [11]",

All rare  and endangered  species.The common name given for this vining species is Oʻahu  Chewstick. [2] It is interesting that this species (G. vitifolia) which is a woody vine or liana is in the same  genus as our two other native gouanias, which are shrub-like. The flowers and fruit, though, look characteristically similar.Other native species in the same family are the indigenous shrub ʻānapanapa (Colubrina asiatica), and two endemic trees, both called kauila or kawila,Alphitonia ponderosaandColubrina oppositifolia.",

A very similar species, the Urban chewstick, or  white root (Gouania lupuloides), is used widely by local people  from Florida, the Caribbean, Mexico, and into Central and South America  as a tooth cleaner. A stick about the thickness of the small finger,  with bark removed, is chewed thus strengthening the gums. The stick  produces a slightly bitter, yet aromatic, soap-like froth (saponins)  when chewed. The softened stick is then used by rubbing the teeth much  like a toothbrush. [3]In times past,  dried and powdered forms were exported to Europe and the United States.  Jamaicans still use chewstick for medicine and in a mouthwash called  \"Chew-Dent.\" They also use it in making ginger beer, a stronger tasting  ginger ale. Chewstick is also used in brewing beer as a hops substitute and is perhaps why  some Jamaican beers have a distinctive taste. [3]",

The prostrate type only occurs in a few areas in the Hawaiian Islands where the prevailing trade winds are stronger than normal. I have seen it in the wild only on northwestern Molokaʻi (east of Moʻomomi), northwestern Lānaʻi, and on Hawai`i in the area of Kalae. On Molokaʻi and at Kalae, where the prostrate type was seen, it was the only type present. On northwestern Lānaʻi, however, the prostrate and erect types occurred together.These cultivated plants of both the prostrate type and the erect type were from northwestern Lānaʻi. The erect type volunteers prolifically in cultivation, whereas the prostrate type only spreads vegetatively.\"Pili is, and was, an important habitat for several native creatures such as land snails.*The harpoon-like attachments on the seeds attach to fur and feathers as a method of dispersal. [7]_____* Small terrestrial snails such asCookeconchaundescribed sp.?,Lyropupa perlonga, andEndodontaundescribed sp.? were once found among pili grass at Koko Head, Oʻahu in great numbers. Now known from sub-fossil/fossil sediments from Barbers Point (Kalaeloa), Oʻahu. These snails may have existed in similar habitats such as those that are found in bunchgrass (Eragrostissp.) on Nīhoa.

        "Early Hawaiian Use": "Dye:A black dye was made from the charcoaled leaf blades. [1]House Construction:Whether indigenous or a Polynesian introduction, early Hawaiians used pili as their first choice for thatching roofs and for its brown color, neat appearance, and pleasant odor. [1,6,8] Pili was harvested by uprooting a bunch. The soil, roots, and flowering spikes were trimmed and the pili bunch was ready for use. They were tied in rows with stems up, placed close together and worked from the bottom of the frame upwards. Pili thatch was replaced every four or five years. [8]Medicinal:Burned pili and ashes mixed with coconut was used for ʻea (thrush) and pāʻaoʻao (childhood disease with physical weakening). [2]Other Uses:The leaves were also used to stuff mattresses, pad floors, and as a tinder. [3]",
        "Modern Use": "Both the upright and prostrate forms are in cultivation and not restricted to the Hawaiian Islands.

Flowers yellow with dark red streaks or splotches at the center. In cultivation, these begin to flower from six months to two years old. These are the fastest growers of the subspecies in cultivation.2. Kealia population (including Haili to Kawaiu) are shorter multi-branching limbs. Stems are moderate spiney to completely spineless. Flowers yellow with dark red streaks or splotches at the center. These are the slowest growers of the subspecies in cultivation.3. Mākua Valley/Molokaʻi population* is very different from the other two populations. This is a scrambling shrub wider than it is tall. Flowers are yellow with a solid dark red center. Most of these begin to flower at less than six months old in cultivation. [7]A devastating fire in August 2007 destroyed over 95% of the wild plants and impacting 85% of this species on Oʻahu.

The native name of the these trees,kokio, possibly relates to the habitat.' \" [8]The specific epithetdrynarioidesis derived from theDrynaria, a genus of ferns, and the Latin -oides, resembling.Hawaiian Name:Hauis an introduced hibiscus (Hibiscus tiliaceus), perhaps by early Hawaiians.Hau hele ʻulaliterally means \"red traveling hau.\"",

        "Early Hawaiian Use": "Agriculture:The early Hawaiians cultivated this species in Kona. [4]Dye:The flower petals were used to make pink and lavender dyes. [3] Sap from the bark produced a dark red waterproof dye for fishnets. The dual-purpose resinous dye would extend the life of the fishing nets and the red color underwater is nearly invisible to fish, thus the fishermen would catch more.Lei:The spectacular flowers were used for lei. [4]Medicinal:The bark was also used to cure thrush.",
        "Modern Use": "Kokia cookeiwas saved from total extinction by grafting scions (a shoot with a bud) on a rootstock from either of its two close relativesKokia drynarioidesandK. kauaiensis(Kauaʻi).With current micropropagation techniques, viable seeds ofKokia cookeihave been able to produce a few seedlings with its own roots.The flowers can be used for a dramatic haku lei (lei poʻo).

        "Additional Habitat Information": "A common indigenous shrub often the principal vegetation component, in from low elevation mesic to wet montane forests, fogswept alpine shrublands, and bogs from 50 to about 10,600 feet on all the main Hawaiian Islands, except Niʻihau and Kahoʻolawe, where it may have occured in the past.Also from the Marquesas Islands (Nuku Hiva).",
        "General Information": "Formerly in the family Epacridaceae, pūkiawe (Leptecophylla tameiameiae) now joins the Ericaceae or the Heath family along with the three endemic ʻōhelo (Vacciniumspp.).",
        "Etymology": "The generic nameLeptecophylla, from the Greekleptekes, thin at the point, andphyllon, leaf, aptly describing another feature of pūkiawe--the fine pointed-leaves. [3,12]The specific epithettameiameiaeis named in behalf of King Kamehameha I, or Kamehameha the Great (c.1758-1819), who established the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi in 1810. Incidentally, his full Hawaiian name was Kalani Paiʻea Wohi o Kaleikini Kealiʻikui Kamehameha o ʻIolani i Kaiwikapu kaui Ka Liholiho Kūnuiākea. Heh! ...and you thoughtyouhad a long name.Hawaiian Names:Kāwaʻuis a name used on Lānaʻi and Maui for this plant, and also for two unrealted plants,Ilex anomalaandMezoneuron kavaiense.Pūkiaweis also a local name for the Black-eyed Susan or Rodsary pea (Abrus precatorius), a vining legume, the seeds of which are used for lei, rosaries, and costume jewelry. [7]",
        "Background Information": "Pūkiawe is regarded by some as a \"weed\" of no forage value. [2,13]Nēnē, or Hawaiian goose (Branta sandvicensis) and other birds, eat pūkiawe berries and thus add in the spread the shrub. [12]The sapwood is said to be light reddish-brown, while the heartwood is dark reddish-brown. It is a fine-textured heavy wood of moderate hardness. [13]",
        "Early Hawaiian Use": "Medicinal:The leaves were used for colds or headaches. [7]Lei:The new leaves (liko) and fruit were used by lei makers. [1,4,10,11]Wood:Second stage kapa beaters, called kua kala, were made from several native woods including \"a form of the native pūkiawe.\" [5]The easily accessed wood was used to cremate bodies of bandits (brigands) or \"outlaws.\" [10,12]Other Uses:For the early Hawaiians the entire pūkiawe plant was highly esteemed. Botanist Degener quotes N. B. Emerson: \"When a kapu-chief found it convenient to lay aside his* dread exclusiveness for a time, that he might perhaps mingle with people on equal terms without injury to them or to himself, it was the custom for him--and according to one authority those with whom he intended to mingle joined with him in the ceremony--to shut himself into a little house and smudge himself with the smoke from a fire ofPukeawe. At the conclusion of this fumigation a priest recited apule huikala, a prayer for a dispension.\" [6,8,10,14]_____* (or, presumably she?) [6]",
        "Modern Use": "Today, the branch tips are traditionally used medicinally for headaches (ʻaki). [9]Pūkiawe is also used in lei. [12,13]",

        "General Information": "ʻŌhelo kai is one of the few native members in the Solanaceae or Nightshade family which also includes four species of ʻaiea in the endemic genusNothocestrumand four species of pōpolo (Solanumspp.).ʻŌhelo kai (Lycium sandwicense) is very closely related to the nutritious wolfberry or goji berry (Lycium barbarum,L. chinense). Some other edible family favorites are tomato, potato, eggplant, cape gooseberry or pohā, tomatillo, and green and chili peppers.However, as the family name implies, this group also has some of the deadliest of all plants with sinister names as Apple of Sodom, Angel's trumpet, Porcupine tomato, Thorn apple, Devil's fig, Devil's apple, and Five-Minute plant. Other kin containing toxic chemicals are mandrake (Mandragora officinarum), Jimsonweed (Datura stramonium), and tobacco (Nicotianaspp.). But the \"Queen of Toxins,\" and one of our planets deadliest, is Belladonna (Atropa belladonna), which possess tropane alkaloids. It also goes by the names Devil's berries, Death Cherries, or Deadly nightshade. Then, there are some merely grown for their beautiful flowers like the garden favorites petunias, and the spectacular Golden challice vine (Solandra maxima).",
        "Etymology": "The generic name Lycium is derived fromlykion, the Greek name for a shrub from Lycia (southwestern Turkey) and used by Carl Linnaeus (Carl von Linné), father of modern taxomony.The specific epithetsandwicenserefers to the \"Sandwich Islands,\" as the Hawaiian Islands were once called, and named by James Cook on one of his voyages in the 1770s.

        "Additional Landscape Use Information": "ʻŌhiʻa are essential trees for native landscapes and are not difficult to grow in urban landscapes provided they are given good sunlight, rich organic soil, and excellent drainage.They do well under cultivation. Plants that have become root-bound in pots tend to remain stunted for a long time. Consequently, it is best to plant ʻōhiʻa into the ground before it becomes pot-bound. [22]Since ʻōhiʻa are nearly in constant bloom, they attract numerous bees and other insects. Keep this in mind when choosing planting sites that may be close the entrances & exits to your home.ʻŌhiʻa are sensitive to root disturbance. A few  planting guidelines can help:  Dig a larger planting hole than the root  ball, perhaps as much as twice  as large. Put good drainage material  such as black or red cinder in the  bottom. When planting ʻōhiʻaneversplay out the root ball  but gently place in hole as is. Nor should  ʻōhiʻa be planted too  deep. Soil shouldnevercover the  surface area around trunk base.  Better to err on the side of planting  too high than too low. Water soil  thoroughly. A final watering of  B-vitamin solution can help to  alleviate stress and encourage new root  growth. For small plants water  everyday until established; larger  plants every two or three days should  suffice. New signs of liko, new  growth, is a key to a successful  planting. [David Eickhoff, Native Plants Hawaiʻi]These wonderful trees may be grown in containers if provided with full sun and fertilizer applications at half strength. [6]ʻŌhiʻa is a quick growing species, but will not develop a significant canopy for many years. They tolerate a fair amount of crowding.

[3]Early reports from residents said that some dark-colored ʻōhiʻa flowers near Keahikawelo, Lānaʻi were elele (black) or hāuli (brown), but may have been a very dark shade of yellow. [10]There are also naturally bi-colored (e.g. yellow/orange) flower forms, pehaps known as Lehua mamo ʻōʻā ʻalani (yellow with orange). [Peter VanDyke, Amy Greenwell Etnobotanical Garden, pers. comm.] And in at least one example, there is an ʻōhiʻa that the flowers open as orange (ʻalani) and then turn yellow (mamo) three days later. [Rick Barboza, Hui Kū Maoli Ola]Some believe that a pure, or snow white, flower form of ʻōhiʻa exists.  [816,23] Hawaiian names do give indication to a wide range of whitish  forms: ʻōhiʻa hākea or lehua haʻakea (cream), ʻōhiʻa kea or lehua kea  (clear white), and ʻōhiʻa lehua puakea or lehua pua kea (pale). Certainly pale or light yellow (hālena) flower forms are known to exist.  But do any of these names refer to apure white formas claimed?

This aggressive rust can be a serious problem if not taken care of in a timely manner. At the first sign of ʻōhiʻa rust, infected material can be carefully trimmed off, bagged securely, and disposed of. One suggestion is to put cut pieces in a bottle with a small amount of alcohol before disposing. Then, the plant and any others, including relatives (Eugeniaspp.,Syzygiumspp.), in the area should be treated with a fungicide immediately.

Trees and shrubs can be found in or near coastal sites, dry, mesic and wet forests, wind swept slopes and ridges, arid shrublands, sub-alpine, and even saturated mountain bogs perpetually shrouded by mist where mature flowering ʻōhiʻa may grow only a few inches tall. They can even be commonly seen growing as an epiphyte on hāpuʻu (tree fern). ʻŌhiʻa are often among first to pioneer new bare lava flows providing a safe haven for many plants and animals.It's no wonder that ʻōhiʻa are the most common of all the native Hawaiian trees!",
        "General Information": "ʻŌhiʻa (Metrosiderosspp.) belong to the Myrtle family or Myrtaceae with a current figure at over 5,650 species. [5]Other non-native relatives, many naturalized in  Hawaii, are numerous  and include myrtle, tea tree, strawberry  guava or waiawī ʻulaʻula,  pineapple guava or kuawa, allspice,  eucalyptus, melaleuca or paper  bark,  bottlebrush (Callistemon), and Surinam  cherry (Eugenia uniflora)--to  name a  few. Some of these have become  seriously invasives displacing  large tracts of native forests with a  monoscape of a single species. An  extreme example of this is the highly  invasive strawberry guava (Psidium cattleianum) where little vegetation can grow beneath its dense canopy.NativeMetrosiderosinclude five endemic species: Lehua ʻāhihi or ʻāhihi (M. tremuloides), lehua papa (M. rugosa), and three known by the name ʻōhiʻa (M. polymorpha, M. macropusandM. waialealae). But it is the speciespolymorphathat is by far the most common and widest ranging ʻōhiʻa in the islands.Other native Myrtaceae members include the indigenous Beach cherry or nīoi (Eugenia reinwardtiana), and two endemics: the endangered Koʻolau eugenia or nīoi (Eugenia koolauensis), and the fairly common ʻŌhiʻa hā (Syzygium sandwicensis).",
        "Etymology": "The generic nameMetrosiderosis derived from the Greekmetra, heartwood, andsideron, iron, referring to the very hard wood of these plants.The specific epithetpolymorpha, is from the Greekpoly, many, andmorphos, forms, in reference to the numerous forms or shapes of this species.",
        "Background Information": "As already noted, this paricular species is found in numerous forms. The early Hawaiians recognized these distinctive forms. Among them is the varietypumilawhich they gave additonal names such as lehua maka noe, lehua neʻeneʻe, and lehua neneʻe.Several native Hawaiian birds feed on the flowers and among the foliage of ʻōhiʻa. Among them are ʻiʻiwi (Vestiaria coccinea), ʻapapane (Himatione sanguinea), and ʻakohekohe (Palmeria dolei) which feed mostly on the flowers and insects; and foraging among the foliage, ʻakiapolaʻau (Hemignathus munroi), the ʻakialoa's (Hemignathusspp.), and the Black mamo or hoa (Drepanis funerea)--the latter two now extinct. Additionally, the coloration of these birds may have served as camouflague, protecting them in pre-historic times from predators such as the Wood harrier (Circus dossenus) and the stilt-owls (Grallistrixspp.), now extinct, and possibly from the still existing Hawaiian hawk or ʻio (Buteo solitarius). [19]",
        "Early Hawaiian Use": "Early Hawaiians had many uses for ʻōhiʻa. The exceptionally hard wood was fashioned into kapa beaters, prepping boards for kapa (lāʻau kahi wauke), poi boards (papa kuʻi poi), musical instruments, kālāʻau (dancing sticks), idols, spears, pāhoa (daggers), lāʻau (clubs), mallets, standards of kāhili, house construction, gunwales and interior framework for canoes. [1,4,16,17,18,21,24]Lei:From early Hawaii to the present day, flowers, seed capsules and liko  (new leaves) have been used for lei working. Lei ʻōhiʻa, with or without  other material, were given names such as lei lehua ʻula (red flowers),  lei lehua ʻalani (orange flowers), lei lehua melemele (yellow flowers),  and lei liko lehua, made with new leaves. [9]Medicinal:A mixture of ʻōhiʻa flowers, the inner bark of the Polynesian-introduced hau (Hibiscus tiliaceus), and a little water were given to women in labor when childbirth pangs became intense. Each time the woman had severe pains she was given a mouthful to drink. [1,7,11]The liko (new leaves) would be pounded together with lama leaves, leaf buds and flowers to treat thrush in children. To the mixture was added poi (poi lehua) from kalo lehua, heated with hot stones, then cooled and strained before given to the child. [1,12]Also, the liko were also used to stimulate the appetite and digestion of a weakened child. [4] Kaʻaiakamanu, in his third volume, specifically mentions the use \"Metrosideros collina plym Glaberrima\" in the aforementioned treatment, but states that the \"motherchewsthe liko,\" as well pounding methods, before administering it to the baby. [13]The aerial roots (aʻa lewa) were also used medicinally to stumulate appetite. [24]Other Uses:The wood was also a superior fire wood. [18]",
        "Modern Use": "The very hard, strong wood is much prized today for flooring, furniture, decorative poles, carvings, and ʻukulele keys. [20,21] Sapwood is pale brown, grading gradually into reddish-brown heartwood. [21] Wood takes a fine polish, but is difficult to cure. [22]Beautiful lei made with the flowers, buds and liko are still a favorite as they were in times of old. [9]Leaves are still as a pleasant tea in folk remedies. [21]Because of the abundance of nectar, the plants are classed as a honey plant. Lehua or ʻōhiʻa honey (meli) has a unique flavor to it. [21]",

[2] It does not appear to any more difficult to grow than ʻōhiʻa (M. polymorpha, M. macropus) and can grow at near sea level locations. Provide full and perhaps a little more watering than some otherMetrosiderosspp. in cultivation and you will be rewarded with a very floriferous, which means it flowers a lot, shrub or tree. [David Eickhoff, Native Plants Hawaiʻi]Lehua ʻāhihi are sensitive to root disturbance. A few planting guidelines can help: Dig a larger planting hole than the root ball, perhaps as much as twice as large. Put good drainage material such as black or red cinder in the bottom. When planting lehua ʻāhihineversplay out the root ball but gently place in hole as is. Nor should lehua ʻāhihi be planted too deep. Soil shouldnevercover the surface area around trunk base. Better to err on the side of planting too high than too low. Water soil thoroughly. A final watering of B-vitamin solution will help to alleviate stress and encourage new root growth. For small plants water everyday until established; larger plants every two or three days should suffice. New signs of liko, new growth, is a key to a successful planting.

Cut off infected  material well below the dead area, wrap securely in a plastic bag and  dispose of or completely destroy right away. Whiteflies can infest  ʻōhiʻa as well.ʻŌhiʻa is susceptible to attacks by the bright yellow ʻōhiʻa, or guava, rust (Puccinia psidii)  especially in wet environments or during the rainy season. This  aggressive rust can be a serious problem if not taken care of in a  timely manner. At the first sign of ʻōhiʻa rust, infected material can  be carefully trimmed off, bagged securely, and disposed of. One untested  suggestion is to put cut pieces in a bottle with a small amount of  alcohol before disposing. Then, the plant and any others, including  relatives (Eugeniaspp.,Syzygiumspp.), in the area should be treated with a fungicide immediately. [6]Never add trimmings damaged by ʻōhiʻa rust or black twig borer to a compost pile. [David Eickhoff, Native Plants Hawaiʻi]",

[5]Other non-native relatives, many naturalized in  Hawaii, are numerous  and include myrtle, tea tree, strawberry  guava or waiawī ʻulaʻula,  pineapple guava or kuawa, allspice,  eucalyptus, melaleuca or paper  bark,  bottlebrush (Callistemon), and Surinam  cherry (Eugenia uniflora)--to  name a  few. Some of these have become  seriously invasives displacing  large tracts of native forests with a  monoscape of a single species. An  extreme example of this is the highly  invasive strawberry guava (Psidium cattleianum) where little vegetation can grow beneath its dense canopy.NativeMetrosiderosinclude five endemic  species: Lehua ʻāhihi or ʻāhihi (M. tremuloides), lehua papa (M.  rugosa), and three known by the name ʻōhiʻa (M. polymorpha, M.  macropusandM. waialealae). But it is the speciespolymorphathat is by far the most common and widest ranging ʻōhiʻa in the  islands.Other native Myrtaceae members include the  indigenous Beach cherry or nīoi (Eugenia reinwardtiana), and  two endemics: the endangered Koʻolau eugenia or nīoi (Eugenia  koolauensis), and the fairly common ʻŌhiʻa hā (Syzygium  sandwicensis).",

This usually results in eventual death for the plant. If plants require being in pots for any length of time, long square cones pot are best.Plant uhiuhi when young, at perhaps a foot high or less. Make sure the hole has sufficient drainage because plants do not like excessive amounts of water, especially in the root area. Use caution to avoid disturbing the roots any more than necessary.Seeds that have been inoculated or planted with debris from mature trees seem to do best.Watch for signs of black twig borer and other life-threatening pests. After the plant is established, severely cut back on the watering, doing so only in times of drought. This is a very drought tolerant tree. [David Eickhoff, Native Plants Hawaiʻi]",

        "Special Growing Needs": "Uhiuhi saplings grown in pots do not have a massive root system that fills the pot. So, when removing uhiuhi from the pot much of the soil falls away leaving exposed roots with little or no soil. To prevent this from happening, it is suggested growing plants with fibrous root systems, such as native grasses or koʻokoʻolau (Bidensspp.)in the same potwith uhiuhi. These plants will help to create a root mass in the pot encompassing the uhiuhi roots, and making the transformation to a planting site more successful and less stressful for the uhiuhi. [12]As already mentioned, uhiuhi do not do well in pots. As they grow larger, the roots tend to coil and strangle the plant. Root coiling stunts tree development and can eventually kill the tree. To avoid this until ready to plant out to a site location, they are best grown in deep pots will which allow the roots to grow longer and resulting in healthier trees. When planted out, the longer roots will already be deeper into the soil where it is cooler and where moisture is more likely to be retained during drought-like periods.See above section \"Additional Landscape Use Information.\"",

        "Early Hawaiian Use": "Early Hawaiians had many uses for uhiuhi. They fashioned the very hard wood into digging tools (ʻōʻō), war clubs and daggers, prepping boards for kapa (lāʻau kahi wauke), kapa beaters, kalo (taro) cutters, [2] spears for heʻe (octopus), fishing implements (lāʻau melomelo or lāʻau mākālei), and shark hooks (makau manō) fitted with bone points. [1,7,8] The strong wood was also used in house (hale) construction for posts, rafters and perlins. [1,7]Games & Sports:Uhiuhi, or usually māmane, wood was also used for sled runners in a sport for the aristocrats called hōlua. The slopes, or sledding track, called kahua hōlua were usually made with layers of grass or ti leaves. [7,11]The papa hōlua, the sled used for this sport, was made of two narrow  runners and were 7 to 12 or 18 feet long, 2 or 3 inches deep, rounded on  the bottom, and highly polished. The front end tapered off and turned  upward so as not to dig into the soil. The two runners were fastened  together by a number of short pieces of wood laid horizontally across  and lashed to the runners with cordage. Matting on the platform was  lashed to the crossbars separating the runners.Notes the Huliheʻe Palace website: \"The person about to slide gripped the sled by the right hand grip, ran a few yard to the starting place, grasped the other hand grip with the left hand, threw himself forward with all his strength, fell flat on the sled and slid down the hill. His hands held the handgrips and the feet were braced against the last cross piece on the rear portion of the sled. The sport was extremely dangerous as the sleds attained high speed running down hill. Much skill was necessary to keep an even balance and to keep from running off the slide or overturning the sled. In competitions, the sled that went the farthest, won.\" [3]Lei:One older source (Charles Gaudichaud,1819) states that Hawaiians \"used  all fragrant plants, all flowers and even colored fruits\" for lei  making. The red or yellow were indicative of divine and chiefly rank;  the purple flowers and fruit, or with fragrance, were associated with  divinity. Because of their long-standing place in oral tradition, the flowers of uhiuhi were likely used for lei making by early Hawaiians,  even though there are no written sources. [4]Medicinal:The bark and young leaves pounded with other plants were pounded, squeezed and liquid taken to purify the blood. [5]",

In shadier locations, these ferns can grow quite tall and may be used as a delicate screening plant.They do well in large planting containers in shade to partial shade with ample moisture. In tall, narrow or smaller pots, place enough rock material in the bottom to prevent the plants from toppling (huli) over in wind gusts. However, limpleaf ferns seem to do best in the ground.Tips may brown with too much sun or lack of water. But this is a forgiving fern and will come back with new shoots if it has not experienced long periods of drought.

Potted ferns showing poor color or not producing crosiers (fiddleheads or emerging fronds), use a complete fertilizer at half the recommended strength.

Trim near the base but be careful not to injure new fronds, or fiddles, since they grow so close together.Otherwise, to keep a natural look fronds can be left on the plants and will eventually fall off and enrich the soil. Richard Quinn, landscape architect in Hawaiʻi, notes that \"native ferns like Pala nui can be an important component of an ecosytem approach to using native plants in landscping.

As with most other naio forms they will remain vibrant in xeric or drought tolerant conditions.An excellent choice for dry, hot lowland areas. Poor drainage and damp soil will eventually kill these plants, which favor arid conditions. Naio will grow well in cloudy, rainy, mauka areas if ample sun and drainage is provided. [9]How to Plant a Native Hawaiian Gardennotes that the \"naio from Manini Gulch, Oʻahu, is particularly attractive and long-lasting in cultivation.\" [9]Companion Plants:Because the shade cast is usually not very dense, naio can be planted close to other plants. [9] ʻIlima, pāʻūohiʻiaka or ʻākia can be grown as groundcovers underneath shrub or tree forms.",

        "General Information": "Naio (Myoporumspp.)belongs to the Figwort family or Scrophulariaceae with around 30 species in the Indo-Pacific region. [2] There are three reconized endemic species in the Hawaiian Islands:Myoporum sandwicense(found all the main islands)*,M. degeneri(dry forests from ʻUlupalakua to Kaupo Gap, E. Maui), andM. stellatum(ʻEwa Plain, Oʻahu). The last two are rare species. [4]Myoporum sandwicenseis further divided into two endemic subspecies: subsp.sandwicense(found on all main islands) and subsp.lanaiense(restricted nothern part of Lānaʻi in dry koaiʻa forests). [4]_____* The populations ofMyoporumoutside of the Hawaiian Islands naturally found on Mangaia (Auʻau Enua) in the Cook Islands were formerly included withMyoporum sandwicense.These plants are now classified as a distinct species,Myoporum wilderi, locally called ngaio and restricted to Mangaia, but also is cultivated on Rarotonga by the indigenous people who use the flowers to scent coconut oil. [4]",
        "Etymology": "The generic nameMyoporumis derived from the Greekmyo, close, andporos, pore in reference to the close appearance of the leaf glands of these plants.The species namesandwicenserefers to the \"Sandwich Islands,\" as the Hawaiian Islands were once called, and named by James Cook on one of his voyages in the 1770s. James Cook named the islands after John Montagu (The fourth Earl of Sandwich) for supporting Cook's voyages.Hawaiian Name:Naio*appears to be most commonly used for thisMyoporumspecies.

Incidentally, this non-native is found in the islands and is generally considered a weed.Kōlea lau nui (Myrsine lessertiana) is one of nineteenMyrsinespp. endemic to the Hawaiian Islands.Other native family members include fourteen species ofLysimachiaand the endemic kilioe (Embelia pacifica).",
        "Etymology": "The generic nameMyrsineis comes from the ancient Greek pharmacologist and botanist Pedanius Dioscorides (c.40-90 CE) name for the myrtle, which did not refer to these plants.The specific epithet is named for Baron Benjamin de Lessert (1773-1847), a French business man, naturalist, and author ofIcones plantarum.",
        "Early Hawaiian Use": "Studies have found that early Hawaiian settlements in Waimanalo, dating  close to A.D. 450 [450 C.E.], have fire pits with charcoal of kōlea lau  nui within them and thus indicating that these plants grew much lower in  elevation than it does today. [Rick Barboza, Hui Kū Maoli Ola]Early Hawaiians used the strong wood for posts, gunwales for canoes, and beams in hale construction as well as to make anvils for beating kapa (tapa). [1,3]Dye:The pinkish bark produces a red sap was used to make red dye and the wood charcoal to make black dye. [3]Medicinal:The bark, leaves, and flowers of kōlea (Mysinespp.) were used medicinally to treat pāʻaoʻao (childhood disease, with physical weakening) and ʻea (thrush). [2]",

When the small ferns begin to show a few fronds, they can easily be removed with some of the surrounding soil to make new plants without upsetting the entire pot. Be sure to fill in the pukas with more soil. It is, though, a good practice to repot these ferns every year or two because they will become root bound and plantlets will begin to appear from the drainage holes. [David Eickhoff, Native Plants Hawaiʻi]They do very well in the landscape as a groundcover in a rich organic mix in moist, but not soggy, soil. [4] With some sun protection, such as under tall shrubs or trees, the plants will remain vibrant dark green. Sometimes they will even climb trees. [David Eickhoff, Native Plants Hawaiʻi]Does very nicely on north and east facing locations, but plants grown on the west and south sides will get scorched if not protected, especially during the intense summer months.

Puna (Hawaiʻi) and Hāna (Maui) also once had large groves. [4]Today wild populations are found on the windward coasts and lower valleys of the main islands, in groves ranging from a few trees to thousands. [1] A poplation of hala above Kahana Bay, windward Oʻahu, on the way to Puʻu Piei, are much shorter in height than many coastal plants. [David Eickhoff, Native Plants Hawaiʻi]",
        "General Information": "Hala or Pandanus are members of the Screw pine family (Pandanaceae).There are two indigenous family representatives. The other, ʻieʻie (Freycinetia arborea), is commonly seen in mesic or wet forests ascending trees or sprawling over rocks or on the ground.",
        "Etymology": "The generic name is derived from the Amboinese termpandan, Latinized to producePandanus.The Latin specific epithettectoriuscarries the meanings \"of plasterer; of rooftops, growing on rooftops, of the tiles.\" [8]Hawaiian Name:The nameHalahas various meanings. (See below \"Early Hawaiian Use\" under \"Lei:\")",
        "Background Information": "Hala is one of the classic picturesque coastal trees of the South Pacific.\"Pandan or screw pine\" is one of the few plants that were listed as an emergency food during World War II in a  manual called “Emergency Food Plants and Poisonous Plants of the Islands of the Pacific” by the War Department. The manual states that “the purpose of this manual is to aid the individual who becomes separated from his unit…so that this individual can live off the land.” It then briefly identifies the plant and how to prepare it.

        "Early Hawaiian Use": [
            "Hala. The common yellow to red keys.",
            "Hala ʻīkoi. Keys are lemmon colored at base; bright orange upper half.",

        "Modern Use": "Today, lei are made from the unripe fruit (keys) and have apparently lost its initial negative connotation. [3] The keys are said to smell like pumpkin. [11]Floor and table mats, hats, purses, baskets and other items continued to be made today using lau hala. [11]Heidi Bornhorst, a local horticulturalist, notes that \"a papale (hat) made of  lau hala is an heirloom that can last 100 years or more if properly cared for. A yearly dip in the ocean is recommended to keep it supple.\" [9]Bornhorst comments that \"weavers say the best lau hala (hala leaves) are from young hala growing in salty, windy areas. Wet Wailau Valley on Molokai, where fierce, salty winds blow, is prime lau hala habitat.\" [9]Hala Use Outside of Hawaiʻi:In other parts of the Pacific, sails, hats, kites, thatching, satchels, and garments were and often still made from lau hala. [11]Hala is not a generally used food in the Hawaiian, now or in earlier times, probably due to the varieties here. However, Pandanus fruit (keys) is eaten in other Pacific areas where fruit is more edible because of varietal differences. [15]",

James Cook named the islands after John Montagu (The fourth Earl of Sandwich) for supporting Cook's voyages.Hawaiian Names:Pōpolo kū maiis a name also used by another unrelated plant, the very rare nativeSolanum imcompleteum.",
        "Background Information": "The Hawaiian pokeberry or Pōpolo kū mai, is one of the few truly poisonous  native plants to mammals and humans. Birds, however, are unaffected by the toxins and feed on the berries which help in seed dispersal. All parts pf the plants contain alkaloid phytolaccine and  other triterpene toxins which impair formation or damage of red blood  cells. The toxins also irritate the digestive system and can affect the  central nervous system. [1]The non-native red inkplant (Phytolacca octandra) is naturalized on Kauaʻi, Oʻahu, Molokaʻi, Lānaʻi, and Maui, and hybridizes with pōpolo kū mai where the two species occur together.",
        "Early Hawaiian Use": "Early Hawaiians used the dark purple berries of pōpolo kū mai as a tattoo dye. [2]",
        "Modern Use": "So, given its toxic nature, why would one want to grow pōpolo kū mai in their garden? Well, we might be  surprised to learn that many plants we have growing in our own yard, or even inside our homes,  are many times more toxic than our native pokeberry. The combination of good knowledge, common sense, and caution are keys with handlinganyplantthat one is unfamiliar with.That said, pōpolo kū mai are attractive shrubs, especially  during flowering and fruiting, and have potential for future landscaping  needs. These have recently been seen more in landscapes and introduced by native Hawaiian plant enthusiasts. They appear to grow well from near sea level and lower elevations (at least down to 300 ft.) in Hawaiʻi. [David Eickhoff, Native Plants Hawaii]",

[9]",
        "Early Hawaiian Use": "Early Hawaiians used māmaki wood to make clubs and kapa beaters (iʻe kuku). [6] The branches were used as \"bait for cowries.\" [9]Clothing:The sap mixed with water was used to keep the kapa (tapa) wauke moist in  preparation process. [1] But māmaki itself was an important source of  for kapa. [7] Though the second best choice of kapa, it was more durable than wauke. [13] However, the kapa māmaki was durableonlywhen dry. It tore like paper if  washed or got wet, whereas wauke could be washed. [7,10,11,13]  The inner bark of māmaki was  made into a brown colored kapa when wauke was not available. [1] Kapa māmaki was made in the same way as kapa wauke. [13] The kapa  quality was said to beverygoodand fit for a king! [1]  It has been noted that in a well-known Hawaiian collection, it is  estimated that more than a third of the kapa samples were made from  māmaki (Pipturusspp.) [9]Māmaki for tapa was mostly made on the island of Hawaiʻi. On other islands, māmaki was usually mixed with wauke when used for kapa. [13]ʻŌlapa bark and kūpaoa (Dubautiaspp.) were used to scent māmaki kapa. [12]Medicinal:Women ate māmaki fruits and seeds during the later months of pregnancy. [1,6] The fruit was also used in healing sores and wounds. [4] Mothers gave the small white fruit to children as a mild laxative or to treat ʻea (thrush). [1,4,13] Seeds were given to infants and adults as a tonic for general debility of the body. [6,13]The leaves and bark of two varieties, māmaki keʻokeʻo and māmaki ʻulaʻula, were consumed and recognized as \"greatly desired by the Hawaiians.\" There were no medical complications, with \"both of them a blessing for those who are weak and frail.\" [8]Berries were also used to dress sores and wounds. [13]Also, see above comment under \"Background Information\" regarding \"green māmaki.\"",
        "Modern Use": "Dried or fresh māmaki leaves are used to make a mild but invigorating and healthy tea and one of few commercially available native herbs for consumption. The tea helps with listlessness. Māmaki leaves generally have a more pleasant aroma and taste than koʻokoʻolau. [2]  The fresh or dried leaves for mamaki tea have been used to help with many internal disorders such as for the stomach, colon, bladder, liver, and bowels. [3]Fruit is eaten as a laxative or for stomach, colon and digestive problems. [9]Infused leaves can be used in treatment for high blood pressure, high cholesterol, liver problems, depression, bladder problems, bladder infections, and PMS. However, with some people māmaki can cause mild agitation or insomnia. [9]Practioner David Bruce Leonard adds: \"A remarkable friend, māmaki has a soothing effect on the nervous system in a similar way to jasmine tea. It works well for iritability or just to decompress after a day in Babylon.\" [9]",

        "Etymology": "The generic namePisoniais named for William Piso (ca.  1611-1678), Dutch physician, pharmacist, botanist, and early writer on  medicinal plants of Brazil.The species namesandwicensisrefers to the \"Sandwich Islands,\" as the Hawaiian Islands were once called, and named by James Cook on one of his voyages in the 1770s. James Cook named the islands after John Montagu (The fourth Earl of Sandwich) for supporting Cook's voyages.Hawaiian Names:The namepāpalaalso is used for the native species ofCharpentiera.Hawaiian Dictionaries defineskēpauas \"lead, pitch, tar, resin, pewter; gum, as on ripe breadfruit; any sticky juice, as of pāpala.\" [6]The nameāuluis shared by two other native treesPlanchonella[Pouteria]sandwicensisandSapindusoahuensis.Kauluis a Kauaʻi name for this plant.",
        "Early Hawaiian Use": "Bird Catching:Āulu, or pāpala kēpau are truly fascinating plants with a sad, but interesting,   cultural history. A sinistral use for the sticky fruit was to trap   native birds. [5] The captured victims provided feathers for the   strikingly colorful cloaks (capes), helmets, lei, images and kāhili.   Birds such as 'ō'ō and mamo were plucked of their few moulting yellow   feathers and set free to grow more for the next season. However, this was not the case with the ʻiʻiwi, ʻamakihi and ʻapapane which were totally covered with red- or green-colored feathers and would not have survived the plucking. They were captured, plucked and eaten. [1,4]Medicinal:The milky sap from pāpala kēpau (Pisoniaspp.) was used for cuts.  The cooked leaves were used to cure pāʻaoʻao (childhood disease with  physical weakening) and for lepo paʻa (constipation). [3]Other Uses:The early Hawaiians used an adhesive gum from āulu for repairing bowls. [1]",

Hosmer's Grove, Maui is one of Hosmer's forestry experimental using non-native species he planted in 1910. Unfortunately, some of the species are now invasive on Maui, such as the Mexican weeping pine, Monterrey pine, and eucalyptus, displacing the native plants. [4]",
        "Background Information": "The Hawaiian crow, or ʻalalā, (Corvus tropicus)  fed on this hōʻawa, attracted by the bright orange inside color of the  ripe fruit capsules and dark seeds and thus ensuring the spread of the  plants. However, ʻalalā are now extremely rare and populations of hōʻawa  in the birds former range are becoming very scarce as a result. This is  a classic example of how interdependent native Hawaiian plants and  animals are in the natural ecosystem.

The Greek suffix -dendron, tree, is added to the generic name.The new generic namePolysciasis from the Greek word \"many-shades\" in reference to the foliage.The specific epithetracemosais the Greek word for raceme in reference to the spectacular hanging inflorescence (floral arrangement) of this species.Hawaiian Name:Pōkalakalais a named shared by the endemic Hawaiian prickly poppy (Argemone glauca), more commonly known byPua kala.",
        "Background Information": "Formerly, this species belonged to the Hawaiian endemic monotypic genus*Munroidendron. Recently it has been placed in the genusPolyscias, comprising over 100 species.*A monotypic genus is a genus havingonly onespecies. Other examples of monotypic genera endemic to the Hawaiian Islands are the native begonia called pua maka nui (Hillebrandia sandwicensis), kanaloa (Kanaloa kahoolawensis), olonā (Touchardia latifolia), kanawao (Broussaisia arguta), and a tall native species of grass (Dissochondrusbiflorus).",
        "Early Hawaiian Use": "The Hawaiian name Pōkalakala suggests that it was apparently known, and perhaps used, by early Hawaiians. [1] But as to how is not known.",
        "Modern Use": "Preliminary tests with the fruits produce a rich purple dye when wet and dry to a lighter plum color. [Kaʻiulani de Silva, Kapa Mau]",

These types of potting containers tend to breath better and allow potting mix to dry out quicker, essential for the health of these xeric plants. Too, the weight of the pots will help these succulents from toppling over in windy conditions and as they grow larger in the pots. Use a very dry potting mix (i.e. cactus mix) with perfect drainage.This species has proven to be a great indoor plant, butonly if used in a very sunny window plantedexcellentdrainage. Plant them in a perfect drainage media such as for cactus, that is with mostly free draining potting materials such as a 4:1 ratio of 4 parts perlite and/or black cinder to 1 part good potting \"soil\" (e.g.Sunshine #4).

[11,12]Loulu lelo is now restricted to mostly Huelo Islet, a 200-foot seastack, rising from the ocean off the windward coast of Molokaʻi. [11,12] About 200 loulu lelo live in the 2 to 3 acre a top this islet due to the absence of rats and goats. [3,12]Also, there are a few palms on the nearby islet of Mōkapu.

[10]Loulu lelo, lit., yellowish loulu, is a specific name given for thisPritchardia. [10]",
        "Background Information": "Fossil evidence show that loulu were once widely spread throughout the islands, especially in the lowlands. Laysan once had dense loulu (Pritchardiasp.) forests as found in recent pollen samples.Pritchardia hillebrandiiis related toP. glabrata, P. kaalae,  P. maideniana,andP. remotaand is similar toPritchardia affinisbut much shorter in height.

        "Early Hawaiian Use": "Loulu (Pritchardiaspp.): The hard wood of the trunk of taller species of loulu were fashioned into spears by early Hawaiians.The fruits called hāwane or wāhane were peeled   and eaten by early Hawaiians. They collected young fruits. The flavor of   young fruit with the soft interior is similar to coconut. The trunks   loulu were notched for climbing to gather the immature fruits and   fronds. Older specimens still bear notches that can be seen today. [9]The fronds, or leaves, called lau hāwane were   used by the early Hawaiians for thatching and more recently as plaiting   such as papale (hats) and fans.RegardingPritchardia hillebrandii,an even more amazing use by early Hawaiians was a sport somewhat like today's hang gliding. Reportedly, daring souls would climb Huelo Islet seastack, cut suitable fronds, attach fronds like wings, and then jump to glide to the ocean over a hundred feet below! [1]",
        "Modern Use": "Loulu lelo is one of the more commonly seen native Pritchardia's seen in botanical gardens, commercial settings, and in residents.There is a beautiful cultivar or variety called 'Blue Moon' with bluish fronds that have been used in landscaping.",

[7] However, a current revision of the genus now indicates thatP. kahukuensis, formerly a synonym, is a distinct Oʻahu species from the northwestern end of the Koʻoau Mts., always having short hairs on fruit branchlets (rachillae) and smaller fruits thanP. martii. [5,7]",
        "Early Hawaiian Use": "Loulu (Pritchardiaspp.): The hard wood of the trunk of taller species of loulu were fashioned into spears by early Hawaiians.The fruits called hāwane or wāhane were peeled and eaten by early Hawaiians. They collected young fruits. The flavor of young fruit with the soft interior is similar to coconut. The trunks loulu were notched for climbing to gather the immature fruits and fronds. Older specimens still bear notches that can be seen today. [5]The fronds, or leaves, called lau hāwane were used by the early Hawaiians for thatching and more recently as plaiting such as papale (hats) and fans.",

        "Etymology": "The generic name is named for William Thomas Pritchard (1829-1907), 19th century British counsul in Fiji, adventurer, and author ofPolynesian Reminiscencesin 1866.The specific epithetremotais from the Latinremotus, secluded or distant, literally \"set aside\" in reference to the range of this species restricted to the island of Nīhoa. [13]Hawaiian Names:Loulu, pronounced low-loo, means \"umbrella,\" because the leaves were formerly used as protection from rain or sun.The namesHāwaneandWāhanerefers the fruit or nut of theloulu, but can also refer to the palm itself. The name is also used for a small redlimuor seaweed (Polysiphoniaspp.). [10]Louluis the Hawaiian name for all species ofPritchardiain the Hawaiian Archipelago. The name has at times been misspelled asLoʻulu. However,Loʻulu, with ʻokina, is the name of the endemic Hawaiian fernConiogramme pilosa.Louluis also used for a species of filefish (Alutera monoceros),       perhaps so called because its greenish-white skin resembled the    loulu    palm. It was used in sorcery to cause death because the name    contains    the wordlou, to hook. [10]Nouluis a variation ofLoulu. [10]",
        "Background Information": "When the early Polynesians first settled on Nīhoa (between A.D. 1000-1700) this species was probably much more widespread. Loulu were cleared for agriculture to support the few inhabitants. Today, loulu concentrate on growing on the remains of the agricultural terraces built by the earlier residents. [5]Humans lived on Nīhoa for sometime, but loulu did make a comeback. In July 1885, however, a fire accidentally set by someone in the large party of 200 accompanying Princess Liliʻuokalani's visit, destroyed most of the loulu on the island. [5] Censuses since then indicate that the palms have been making a slow recovery over the years.Pritchardia remotais today considered rare and critically endangered with less than 700 found in a 1996 survey remaining on Nīhoa. [3,5] Potential sites for re-establishment include Necker (Molumanamana), Laysan (Kauō), Midway (Pihemanu), and Kauaʻi. [5]Pritchardia remotais related toP. glabrata, P. hillebrandii, P. kaalae,andP. maideniana. [11]On Nīhoa, loulu provide nesting and roosting habitat for seabirds. [5]Green fruits taste and have a texture like mild coconut-flavored gummy bears. [David Eickhoff, Native Plants Hawaiʻi]",
        "Early Hawaiian Use": "Besides using the trunks (wood) for shelter, loulu leaves (lau hāwane) were used for shelter, thatching, mats and perhaps to plait hats. [5,12]The fruits (hāwane or wāhane) were eaten on Niʻihau, likely on Nīhoa as well, and taste like coconut. [2,12]On Niʻihau, some battle spears were made from loulu. [12]",
        "Modern Use": "As previously mentioned this fast growing species does well in lowland urban areas and is tolerant of many soil and weather conditions.",

The other  child, without broken branches, was the winner and announced his  victory by crowing like a rooster (moa).” [1] One of the names ʻoʻō moa  in fact means \"cock's crow.\"Lei:Moa was also used in lei making by early Hawaiians. [1]Medicinal:Moa (Psilotumspp.) was used for kūkae paʻa (constipation) in newborn babies and elderly men and women. It was also mixed with other plants to treat akepau (tuberculosis, consumption), and various respiratory conditions. [2] Additionally, extracts from moa were used as laxatives.

        "Additional Habitat Information": "Moa is a pantropical species found on all the Main Hawaiian Islands in dry to wet areas from near sea level to 4000 feet on rocks, lava flows, and as epiphytically on tree trunks and forks of branches. It can be weedy in urban areas growing in nearly every environment.A collection ofPsilotum nudummade in 1923 from Midway Atoll was discovered in 2008 in the collections of the Herbarium Pacificum (Bishop Museum). [7]",
        "General Information": "Psilotumbelong to the Whisk-fern family (Psilotaceae) withonlytwo wide spread species:PsilotumcomplanatumandP.nudus. Both species are indigenous to the Hawaiian Islands.",
        "Etymology": "The generic name is from the Greekpsilos, naked or smooth, alluding to the smooth aerial stems without leaves.The specific epithet  is from the Latinnudus, bare or naked, in reference to the naked nature of the stems.So then, the apparently redundant namePsilotumnudumrefers to a really naked,nakedplant!Hawaiian Names:Moa naheleliterally means \"forest chicken.\"Moais chicken, referring to a chickens' comb, and reference to the fronds.",
        "Background Information": "The two native species of moa (Psilotumspp.) can hybridize when found together.In the Hawaiian Islands, the hybrid is an infrequent to locally common plant found in mesic to wet forests, from 1640 to about 2790 feet, on Kauaʻi, Oʻahu (particularly in the Waiʻanae Mountains), Lānaʻi, and Maui and is referred to asPsilotum x intermedium.",
        "Early Hawaiian Use": "Games & Sports:Early Hawaiian children would play a simple game of moa nahele (lit., chicken vegetation).Plants in Hawaiian Cultureexplains how this game was played: “Two children sat or stood facing  one another, each holding a branched stem of moa. These they interlocked  and then slowly pulled apart until the branches of one broke. The other  child, without broken branches, was the winner and announced his  victory by crowing like a rooster (moa).” [1,5,6] One of the names ʻoʻō  moa in fact means \"cock's crow.\"Lei:Moa was also used in lei making by early Hawaiians. [1]Medicinal:Moa (Psilotumspp.) was used for kūkae paʻa (constipation) in newborn babies and elderly men and women. It was also mixed with other plants to treat akepau (tuberculosis, consumption), and various respiratory conditions. [2] Additionally, extracts from moa were used as laxatives. A tea, using the whole plant, was brewed and contains cathartic properties to purge the bowels. [5] The spores were used for diarrhea in infants and used like talcum powder to prevent chafing from loincloths. [4,5,6]",
        "Modern Use": "Moa continues to be a part modern lei making for the neck, head, wrist, ankle, and horse. [3]They can also be used in floral arrangement and have a vase life of a week or two. [3]",

        "Early Hawaiian Use": "Many tools and fishing implements were made from the hard wood of alaheʻe. Spears, from 6 to 13 feet long, were fashioned for capturing heʻe (octopus), as well as for ʻōʻō, fishhooks, shark hooks (makau manō) with bone points, short spears (ʻo), and dip nets for fish and crabs. [1,2,5,8,9] The wood was also made into adze blades for cutting softer wood such as wiliwili and kukui. [5]Also, there is an example at the Bishop Museum (Honolulu, Hawaiʻi) of the wood fashioned into a bowl. [10]Dyes:Reportedly a dark brown or black dye was produced from the leaves of alaheʻe by early Hawaiians. [5,9]Lei:One older source (Charles Gaudichaud,1819) states that Hawaiians \"used   all fragrant plants, all flowers and even colored fruits\" for lei   making. The red or yellow were indicative of divine and cheifly rank;   the purple flowers and fruit, or with fragrance, were associated with   divinety. Because of their long-standing place in oral tradition, the  leaves and flowers of alaheʻe were likely used for lei making by early  Hawaiians,  even though there are no written sources. [4]Medicinal:The leaves and \"the white skin of the stem\" are prepared by cooking and the bitter medicine is drunk to cleanse the blood. [6]",
        "Modern Use": "Great native trees sometimes used in xeric landscapes.Leaves and flowers resemble mock orange, though not related to them, and may be a suitable native replacement for them. The flowers also have a more pleasant fragrance than mock orange flowers (Philadelphus coronarius).",

        "Etymology": "The generic namePteridiumis derived from the Greekpteris, fern, andpteron, wing or feather, in reference to fronds suggesting the spread wings of a bird.The specific epithetaquilinum, is Latin for eagle (Aquila).The varietial namedecompositumis from the Latinde, very, andcompositus, compound, in reference to the frond division.Hawaiian Names:The namekīlauis also used for a ti (kī)  stalk with shredded leaves, as held by a fishing director (kilo iʻa) and  used to guide the fishing canoes; ti stalk used to flip water of  purification. [5]",
        "Background Information": "Kīlau are one of the few deciduous native plants in the Hawiian Islands. Fronds turn brown and die back in the winter, although rhizomes are still alive. In the early spring, bright green fiddleheads (fronds) emerge. Then by late summer or early, the mature fronds will turn brown and eventually die back by the winter. [4] However, it has been noticed that some lower elevation plants may remain green year round or only some of the fronds may die back. [David Eickhoff, Native Plants Hawaiʻi]In many countries bracken is often treated as a weed and spoil pastures for grazing animals because of its poisonous properties. [3] However, feral pigs favor the rhizomes and will root up entire patches. [4]",
        "Modern Use": "In Hawaiʻi, kīlau is collected and use in  wasari. But \"because bracken fern has cancerous properties and a nerve  poison, it should be eaten infrequently and in moderation.\" [2]A substitute for bracken, is the Vegetable fern (Diplazium esculentum),  naturalized in Hawaii, and often called hōʻiʻo in local markets. Hōʻiʻo  can be prepared the same way as bracken, but \"is not known to have  these anti-nutritional qualities so it can be eaten freely.\" [1] The  species nameesculentais Latin for edible, alluding to the use of this fern for food. [1]Outside of the Hawaiian Islands:Bracken has been used throughout in many cultures around the world. The fiddlehead (immature unfurled fronds) are bitter, but used fresh, cooked, or preserved by pickling, salting, or sun drying. For example, in Korea, called gosari, they are used in bibimbap or gosari-namul, a sauteed side dish; and as a vegetable dish in Japan, called wasari. [2]Native Americans pound the rhizomes in making a stachy flour for bread; and in Japan used a starch to make confections. [2]Bracken has been used as fodder for animals, but it can injure or poison them. So, it often used as litter in animal pens. [3]",

        "Additional Habitat Information": "Neleau is found in scattered locations throughout its range and most common near Hilo and Waimea (Kamuela) on Hawaiʻi Island from around 500 to over 7,000 feet.On Kauaʻi, neleau can be seen at Makaweli, and Kamaliʻi Ridge; on Oʻahu, at Nuʻuanu and Moanalua valleys, and at Hoʻomaluhia; and on Molokaʻi, in Pelekunu Valley.",
        "General Information": "Neleau (Rhus sandwicensis) belongs to the Mango or Cashew family (Anacardiaceae). This is the only member native and endemic to the Hawaiian Islands.Some well known edible kin include mango (Mangiferaspp.), cashew (Anacardium occidentale), and pistachio (Pistachia vera). The highly invasive Christmas berry (Schinus terebinthifolius) is on the family list as well.The family also has some unsavory characters in aptly named genusToxicodendron, meaning \"poison tree,\" and they include poison-ivy, poison-oak, and poison sumac--the latter is perhaps the most toxic plant in the United States.",
        "Etymology": "The generic nameRhusis derived fromrhous, the Greek name for sumac.The species namesandwicensisrefers to the \"Sandwich Islands,\" as the Hawaiian Islands were once called, and named by James Cook on one of his voyages in the 1770's. James Cook named the islands after John Montagu (The fourth Earl of Sandwich) for supporting Cook's voyages.",

        "Background Information": "ʻĀkala will naturally or artifically hybridize with other species. A putative population of hybrids between the native ʻākala (Rubus hawaiensis) and the naturalized thimbleberry (R. rosifolius) were recently found in Kīpahulu Valley, Maui. Thus far, these have turned out to be sterile hybrids with no backcrossing to either parent. [11]Nector feeding birds or nectivores, especially ʻiʻiwi, use flowers as a food source. Other honeycreepers (e.g. ʻŌʻū) will eat the large fruits piecemeal. [14]",
        "Early Hawaiian Use": "Clothing:Early Hawaiians used fibers of ʻākala (Rubus hawaiensis, R. macraei) bark to make kapa (tapa), but was inferior to wauke, māmaki, ʻoloa (Neraudia melastomifolia), or ʻulu (breadfruit). [3,16] Kapa cloth was made from the inner bark of the ʻākala stem, yet was not of poor quality. Some authors believe kapa was never made from the inner bark of ʻākala. [16]Dyes:ʻĀkala fruit was used to produce a pink to rose-colored dye for their kapa (tapa). [2,4,7,13,16]Food:They also ate the berries of both native species and used the flowers and ripe fruits. [2]Medicinal:Ashes from burnt plant material, such as the stem, was used to treat   kēpia (dandruff), heartburn (umauma naha), or mixed with poi to induce vomiting due to stomach ailments (hoaoa luaʻi). [7,8,15] Sometimes the ashes were used for bathing. [9]",
        "Modern Use": "Decades ago, hybrids with native and non-native species were tested, but the flavor of the offspring produced bitter fruits. In 1930, Otto Degener, botanist, writes: \"Dr. Willis T. Pope of the Federal Experiment Station in Honolulu has been growing and hybridizing Rubus hawaiiensis with various raspberies of North America since 1928.\" [10,12] In 1933, W. T. Pope planted three patches ofR. hawaiensisin Waiʻanaeuka, Mount Kaʻala, Oʻahu with plants from Kona, Hawaiʻi Island.Though the fruit is often bitter, they are commonly used to make pies and preserves. [5] They have also been used to make filling for delicious malasadas. [J.B. Friday, College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources]Eating too many berries act as a laxative. [16]",

[Joel Lau, Botanist]ʻIliahialoʻe is common to uncommon on all the main islands but is rare on Kauaʻi. It is now extinct on Laysan (Kauō) and Kahoʻolawe. Though not recorded from Niʻihau, it undoubtedly grew there at one time. [3]",

[10]",
        "Etymology": "The generic nameSantalumis derived fromsantalon, the Greek name for sandalwood.The specific epithetellipticumis from the Latinellipticus, oblong with rounded ends, in reference the shape of the leaves of this species.Hawaiian Names:Lāʻau ʻalaliterally means \"sweet wood\" or \"fragrant wood.\"",
        "Background Information": "ʻIliahi and ʻiliahialoʻe are hemiparasitic, which means they derive some nutrients from their host but are not totally dependent on them as are other native plants such as mistletoe or hulumoa (Korthalsellaspp.), kaunaʻoa (Cuscuta sandwichiana), and kaunaʻoa pehu (Cassytha filiformis)--all of whichareparasitic. [4]The Sandalwood Trade Story:As  with other Hawaiian sandalwoods, ʻiliahialoʻe was subject to the  Sandalwood trade from 1790 to the early 1800's. Most of the sandalwood  shipped from Hawaiʻi came from the lowlands and this species was one of  those used in the trade. [3,4]The  captivating scent of the heartwood has   fueled greed among men throughout  the world. This was the case with a   collaboration of Chinese, American  and Hawaiian merchants and monarchy   in the late 18th century. Due to  China's, as well as a few other   countries, insatiable appetite for  sandalwood, the white sandalwood (Santalum album) imported from India was becoming scarce because of over harvesting and, even to this day, it is an endangered species.With  fewer imports from India, and with the   help of American fur traders,  China now turned their attention to the   Hawaiian sandalwoods or ʻiliahi  and ʻiliahialoʻe. From the 1790's to   mid-1830's, ʻiliahi and the  Hawaiian people who harvested the logs   experienced an incredible  hardship with the exportation of sandalwood   to China. For obvious  reasons, the Chinese in the Canton-Macao area   began to call the Hawaiian  Islands Tang Heung Shan [Tahn Heung Sahn],   or the \"Sandalwood  Mountains.\" [6]Many thousands of  Hawaiians, at the order of   the aliʻi, under Kamehameha I (the Great),  left off agriculture and   worked to supply the Sandalwood Trade. The  consequences were   devastating. Many of the common people (makaʻāinana)  who were used as   laborers died from exposure to cold weather,  exhaustion, malnutrition,   disease or other causes. As a result, during  this dark period Hawaiʻi   suffered through one of the worst famines in  its history. [7]By  the  mid-1830's, the sandalwood supply was nearly  exhausted and the   remaining inferior or smaller pieces were driving  prices and demand   down. Even naio (Myoporumspp.) was trying to  be passed off as   genuine sandalwood with little success. Naio has thus  acquired the   pitiful nickname \"bastard sandalwood.\"In  1839, King Kamehameha III (Kauikeaouli)   placed a kapu on the remaining  ʻiliahi, reserving it for himself. By   1840 the Hawaiian sandalwood trade  basically came to a finish. [8]   Fortunately, the people, the land and  the ʻiliahi have recovered but   not without scars.

        "Early Hawaiian Use": "Though early Hawaiians may not have used sandalwood extensively, it was still valued.Clothing:The fragrant heartwood and bark of ʻiliahialoʻe was pounded to scent the  bad odor of new kapa (tapa), and when added with coconut oil the would  water proof the material. [1,4,11]Lei:One older source (Charles Gaudichaud,1819) states that Hawaiians \"used   all fragrant plants, all flowers and even colored fruits\" for lei   making. The red or yellow were indicative of divine and chiefly rank;   the purple flowers and fruit, or with fragrance, were associated with   divinity. The  leaves, new leaves (liko) and flowers of ʻiliahialoʻe  were used for lei making by  early Hawaiians. Because of their  long-standing place in oral tradition, the leaves, new  leaves (liko)  and flowers of ʻiliahialoʻe were likely used for lei making by  early  Hawaiians, even though there are no written sources. [9]Medicinal:The leaves were used as a shampoo for dandruff and head lice; and a drink from powdered material for male and female sex organs or \"for sores of long duration.\" [1,4]Music:Sometimes used to make ʻūkēkē or musical bow. [4]Other Uses:Sometimes used as firewood. [4]",

It longer has varieties and is now endemic only to Oʻahu. Currently there are six endemic species in the Hawaiian Archipelago. [10]",
        "Etymology": "The generic nameSantalumis derived fromsantalon, the Greek name for sandalwood.The specific epithetfreycinetianumis named in honor of Captain  Loius de  Freycinet (1779-1840), commander of the French exploration on  board of  which was Charles Gaudichaud-Beaupre, the first Western  botanist to come  to the Hawaiian Islands.Hawaiian Names:Lāʻau ʻalalietrally means \"sweet wood\" or \"fragrant wood.\"",
        "Background Information": "ʻIliahi and ʻiliahialoʻe are hemiparasitic, which means they derive some nutrients from their host but are not totally dependent on them as are other native plants such as mistletoe or hulumoa (Korthalsellaspp.), kaunaʻoa (Cuscuta sandwichiana), and kaunaʻoa pehu (Cassytha filiformis)--all of whichareparasitic. [7]The Sandalwood Trade Story:The  captivating scent of sandalwood's heartwood has   fueled greed among men throughout  the world. This was the case with a   collaboration of Chinese, American  and Hawaiian merchants and monarchy   in the late 18th century. Due to  China's, as well as a few other   countries, insatiable appetite for  sandalwood, the white sandalwood (Santalum album) imported from India was becoming scarce because of over harvesting and, even to this day, it is an endangered species.With  fewer imports from India, and with the   help of American fur traders,  China now turned their attention to the   Hawaiian sandalwoods or ʻiliahi  and ʻiliahialoʻe. From the 1790's to   mid-1830's, ʻiliahi and the  Hawaiian people who harvested the logs   experienced an incredible  hardship with the exportation of sandalwood   to China. For obvious  reasons, the Chinese in the Canton-Macao area   began to call the Hawaiian  Islands Tang Heung Shan [Tahn Heung Sahn],   or the \"Sandalwood  Mountains.\" [6]Many thousands of  Hawaiians, at the order of   the aliʻi, under Kamehameha I (the Great),  left off agriculture and   worked to supply the Sandalwood Trade. The  consequences were   devastating. Many of the common people (makaʻāinana)  who were used as   laborers died from exposure to cold weather,  exhaustion, malnutrition,   disease or other causes. As a result, during  this dark period Hawaii   suffered through one of the worst famines in  its history. [7]By  the  mid-1830's, the sandalwood supply was nearly  exhausted and the   remaining inferior or smaller pieces were driving  prices and demand   down. Even naio (Myoporumspp.) was trying to  be passed off as   genuine sandalwood with little success. Naio has thus  acquired a   pitiful nickname \"bastard sandalwood.\"In  1839, King Kamehameha III (Kauikeaouli)   placed a kapu on the remaining  ʻiliahi, reserving it for himself. By   1840 the Hawaiian sandalwood trade  basically came to a finish. [8]   Fortunately, the people, the land and  the ʻiliahi have recovered but   not without scars. While not as common as  in the past, ʻiliahi and   ʻiliahialoʻe are fairly easy to see in its  native habitat though very   large trees are still difficult to find.",
        "Early Hawaiian Use": "Though early Hawaiians may not have used ʻiliahi wood extensively, it was still valued. Besides used as firewood, the light yellow wood was sometimes used to make ʻūkēkē or musical bow. [6]Medicinally, the leaves were used as a shampoo for dandruff and head lice; and a drink from powdered material for male and female sex organs or \"for sores of long duration.\" [1,6]The fragrant heartwood and bark of ʻiliahi was pounded to scent the smell of new kapa (tapa), and when added with coconut oil the would water proof the material. [1,6]One older source (Charles Gaudichaud,1819) states that Hawaiians \"used all fragrant plants, all flowers and even colored fruits\" for lei making.

For obvious  reasons, the Chinese in the Canton-Macao area   began to call the Hawaiian  Islands Tang Heung Shan [Tahn Heung Sahn],   or the \"Sandalwood  Mountains.\" [6]Many thousands of  Hawaiians, at the order of   the aliʻi, under Kamehameha I (the Great),  left off agriculture and   worked to supply the Sandalwood Trade. The  consequences were   devastating. Many of the common people (makaʻāinana)  who were used as   laborers died from exposure to cold weather,  exhaustion, malnutrition,   disease or other causes. As a result, during  this dark period Hawaiʻi   suffered through one of the worst famines in  its history. [7]By  the  mid-1830's, the sandalwood supply was nearly  exhausted and the   remaining inferior or smaller pieces were driving  prices and demand   down. Even naio (Myoporumspp.) was trying to  be passed off as   genuine sandalwood with little success. Naio has thus  acquired the   pitiful nickname \"bastard sandalwood.\"In  1839, King Kamehameha III (Kauikeaouli)   placed a kapu on the remaining  ʻiliahi, reserving it for himself. By   1840 the Hawaiian sandalwood trade  basically came to a finish. [8]   Fortunately, the people, the land and  the ʻiliahi have recovered but   not without scars. While not as common as  in the past, ʻiliahi and   ʻiliahialoʻe are fairly easy to see in its  native habitat though very   large trees are still difficult to find.",
        "Early Hawaiian Use": "Clothing:The early Hawaiians used the powdered heartwood to perfume kapa. [1]Lei:One older source (Charles Gaudichaud,1819) states that Hawaiians \"used all fragrant plants, all flowers and even colored fruits\" for lei making. The red or yellow were indicative of divine and chiefly rank; the purple flowers and fruit, or with fragrance, were associated with divinity. Because of their long-standing place in oral tradition, the leaves, new leaves (liko) and flowers of ʻiliahi were likely used for lei making by early Hawaiians, even though there are no written sources.[4]",
        "Modern Use": "Today, the fruit is sometimes used as a dye. [Ethan Romanchak, Native Nursery, LLC]Flowers are still used for lei. [4]",

[9]",
        "Etymology": "The generic nameSantalumis derived fromsantalon, the Greek name for sandalwood.The specific epithetpaniculatumis derived from the Latinpaniculatus, a botanical description for a branced-racemose or an inflorescence of a plant.Hawaiian Names:Lāʻau ʻalalietrally means \"sweet wood\" or \"fragrant wood.\"",
        "Background Information": "ʻIliahi and ʻiliahialoʻe are hemiparasitic, which means they derive some nutrients from their host but are not totally dependent on them as are other native plants such as mistletoe or hulumoa (Korthalsellaspp.), kaunaʻoa (Cuscuta sandwichiana), and kaunaʻoa pehu (Cassytha filiformis)--all of whichareparasitic. [3]ʻIliahi can and do hybridize with the East Indian, or white, sandalwood (Santalum album), an introduced species also grown in the Hawaiian Islands. [2]Santalum paniculatumis closely related toS. ellipticum.The Sandalwood Trade Story:The  captivating scent of sandalwood's heartwood has  fueled greed among men throughout  the world. This was the case with a  collaboration of Chinese, American  and Hawaiian merchants and monarchy  in the late 18th century.

[3]Other Uses:Sometimes used as firewood. [3]",
        "Modern Use": "In the latter part of the 20th centuryS. paniculatumwood was exported form western Hualālai (Kona District, Hawaiʻi) to Asia.

        "Etymology": "The generic nameSantalumis derived fromsantalon, the Greek name for sandalwood.The specific epithetpaniculatumis derived from the Latinpaniculatus, a botanical description for a branced-racemose or an inflorescence of a plant.The varietal namepileriis named for Robert Knuds Friedrich Pilger (1876-1953), German agrostologist,  traveller, botanical explorer, plant collector, and Director at  Berlin-Dahlem Botanical Gardens.Hawaiian Names:Lāʻau ʻalalietrally means \"sweet wood\" or \"fragrant wood.\"",
        "Background Information": "ʻIliahi and ʻiliahialoʻe are hemiparasitic, which means they derive some nutrients from their host but are not totally dependent on them as are other native plants such as mistletoe or hulumoa (Korthalsellaspp.), kaunaʻoa (Cuscuta sandwichiana), and kaunaʻoa pehu (Cassytha filiformis)--all of whichareparasitic. [3]ʻIliahi can and do hybridize with the East Indian, or white, sandalwood (Santalum album), an introduced species also grown in the Hawaiian Islands. [2]Santalum paniculatumis closely related toS. ellipticum.The Sandalwood Trade Story:The  captivating scent of sandalwood's heartwood has  fueled greed among men throughout  the world. This was the case with a  collaboration of Chinese, American  and Hawaiian merchants and monarchy  in the late 18th century. Due to  China's, as well as a few other  countries, insatiable appetite for  sandalwood, the white sandalwood (Santalum album) imported from India was becoming scarce because of over harvesting and, even to this day, it is an endangered species.With  fewer imports from India, and with the  help of American fur traders,  China now turned their attention to the  Hawaiian sandalwoods or ʻiliahi  and ʻiliahialoʻe. From the 1790's to  mid-1830's, ʻiliahi and the  Hawaiian people who harvested the logs  experienced an incredible  hardship with the exportation of sandalwood  to China. For obvious  reasons, the Chinese in the Canton-Macao area  began to call the Hawaiian  Islands Tang Heung Shan [Tahn Heung Sahn],  or the \"Sandalwood  Mountains.\" [6]Many thousands of  Hawaiians, at the order of  the aliʻi, under Kamehameha I (the Great),  left off agriculture and  worked to supply the Sandalwood Trade. The  consequences were  devastating. Many of the common people (makaʻāinana)  who were used as  laborers died from exposure to cold weather,  exhaustion, malnutrition,  disease or other causes. As a result, during  this dark period Hawaiʻi  suffered through one of the worst famines in  its history. [7]By the  mid-1830's, the sandalwood supply was nearly  exhausted and the  remaining inferior or smaller pieces were driving  prices and demand  down. Even naio (Myoporumspp.) was trying to  be passed off as  genuine sandalwood with little success. Naio has thus  acquired a  pitiful nickname \"bastard sandalwood.\"In  1839, King Kamehameha III (Kauikeaouli)  placed a kapu on the remaining  ʻiliahi, reserving it for himself. By  1840 the Hawaiian sandalwood trade  basically came to a finish. [8]  Fortunately, the people, the land and  the ʻiliahi have recovered but  not without scars. While not as common as  in the past, ʻiliahi and  ʻiliahialoʻe are fairly easy to see in its  native habitat though very  large trees are still difficult to find.",
        "Early Hawaiian Use": "Though early Hawaiians may not have used sandalwood extensively, it was still valued.Lei:One older source (Charles Gaudichaud,1819)  states that Hawaiians \"used all fragrant plants, all flowers and even  colored fruits\" for lei making. The red or yellow were indicative of  divine and chiefly rank; the purple flowers and fruit, or with  fragrance, were associated with divinity. Because of their long-standing  place in oral tradition, the leaves, new leaves (liko) and flowers of  ʻiliahi were likely used for lei making by early Hawaiians, even though  there are no written sources. [8]Medicinal:The leaves were used as a shampoo for dandruff and head lice; and a drink from powdered material for venereal diseases of men and women [4] or \"for sores of long duration.\" [2,3]Music:The wood was sometimes used to make ʻūkēkē or musical bow. [3]Other Uses:Sometimes used as firewood. [3]",
        "Modern Use": "In the latter part of the 20th centuryS. paniculatumwood was exported form western Hualālai (Kona District, Hawaiʻi) to Asia. [1]Currently there is still contriversal some logging being done with this species.

It has been suggested to use a number of different species as hosts to  ensure that ʻiliahi will be provided with enough nutrients and water  from a variety of sources. Too, ʻiliahi are not choosy about host  plants. The health of ʻiliahi is tied to the health of the neighboring  plants.Like other ʻiliahi, this species does best planted out to a permanent  site when young rather than remaining in a pot.

        "Background Information": "The Legend:In ancient times, one version goes, there was a beautiful Hawaiian princess known as Naupaka. One day, the villagers noticed that Naupaka looked very sad. They told her parents, who approached Naupaka and asked her what was troubling her.“I have fallen in love with a man named Kaui,” replied the princess. “But Kaui is not of noble birth—he is a commoner.” According to Hawaiian tradition, it was strictly forbidden for members of royalty to marry people from the common ranks.Distressed, Naupaka and Kaui traveled long and far, seeking a solution to their dilemma. They climbed up a mountain to see a kahuna who was staying at a heiau (temple). Alas, he had no clear answer for the young lovers. “There is nothing I can do,” he told them, “but you should pray. Pray at this heiau.”So they did. And as they prayed, rain began to fall. Their hearts torn by sorrow, Naupaka and Kaui embraced for a final time. Then Naupaka took a flower from her ear and tore it in half, giving one half to Kaui. “The gods won’t allow us to be together,” she said. “You go live down by the water, while I will stay up here in the mountains.”As the two lovers separated, the naupaka plants that grew nearby saw how sad they were. The very next day, they began to bloom in only half flowers.There are different versions of the naupaka legend, but all carry the same unhappy theme: lovers that are separated forever, one banished to the mountains, the other to the beach.

        "Additional Habitat Information": "Naupaka kahakai is an indigenous shrub found throughout tropical and subtropical Pacific and Indian Ocean coasts. It is a common coastal shrub throughout the Hawaiian Archipelago, except on the higher rocky islands of Gardner Pinnacles (Pūhāhonu), Necker (Mokumanamana), and Nīhoa (Moku Manu).",
        "General Information": "Scaevolabelong to the Goodenia family or Goodeniaceae, of which there are over 130 species. There are ten native species of naupaka (Scaevolaspp.). The featured species is the only indigenous naupaka, or scaevola, and the only one to produce white fruit in the Hawaiian Islands. The others are endemic and all produce dark purple fruits.",
        "Etymology": "The generic nameScaevolais derived from the Greekscaevus, left-handed or awkward, perhaps in reference to the \"awkward\" appearance of the \"half flower\" or to the signature flowers resembling an open fan or hand.Since the specific epithetssericeaandtaccadaseem to go back and forth in revisions, we have include the etymology for both.The specific epithetsericeais derived from the Latinsericeus, silky or sikly-hairy, likely in reference to the short hairs found on the foliage of this plant. [7]The specific epithettacccadais [needed]Hawaiian Names:Aupakais a Niʻihau name for this plant.Huahekilimeans \"hailstones.\" [8]Naupaka kahakaimeans \"naupaka by the seashore.\"",
        "Background Information": "The pulpy fruits tolerate salt water and float on the ocean currents for dispersal to other islands, unlike the dark purple fruits of the other native naupaka species which are eaten and dispersed by birds. However, the seeds of naupaka kahakai will only germinate with fresh water. [9]The Legend:In ancient times, one version goes, there was a beautiful Hawaiian princess known as Naupaka. One day, the villagers noticed that Naupaka looked very sad. They told her parents, who approached Naupaka and asked her what was troubling her.“I have fallen in love with a man named Kaui,” replied the princess. “But Kaui is not of noble birth—he is a commoner.” According to Hawaiian tradition, it was strictly forbidden for members of royalty to marry people from the common ranks.Distressed, Naupaka and Kaui traveled long and far, seeking a solution to their dilemma. They climbed up a mountain to see a kahuna who was staying at a heiau (temple). Alas, he had no clear answer for the young lovers. “There is nothing I can do,” he told them, “but you should pray. Pray at this heiau.”So they did. And as they prayed, rain began to fall. Their hearts torn by sorrow, Naupaka and Kaui embraced for a final time. Then Naupaka took a flower from her ear and tore it in half, giving one half to Kaui. “The gods won’t allow us to be together,” she said. “You go live down by the water, while I will stay up here in the mountains.”As the two lovers separated, the naupaka plants that grew nearby saw how sad they were. The very next day, they began to bloom in only half flowers.There are different versions of the naupaka legend, but all carry the same unhappy theme: lovers that are separated forever, one banished to the mountains, the other to the beach. [10]",
        "Early Hawaiian Use": "Food:The pithy fruits were eaten as refreshment on journeys or more or less in times of famine. [2,3]Lei:One older source (Charles Gaudichaud,1819) states that Hawaiians \"used  all fragrant plants, all flowers and even colored fruits\" for lei  making. The red or yellow were indicative of divine and chiefly rank;  the purple flowers and fruit, or with fragrance, were associated with  divinity. Because of their long-standing place in oral tradition, the  flowers of naupaka kahakai were likely used for lei making by early  Hawaiians, even though there are no written sources. [4]Medicinal:Mixed with salt, the fruit or root bark of naupaka kahakai was used for cuts, skin diseases [3,5,6] and wounds. [6]",
        "Modern Use": "Fabric dyes appearing from greenish-yellow to dark green have been made from with different mordants--a metalic substance for setting colors to the fabric. [1]Both flowers and fruits are used today in lei. [4]Local divers know to use the flowers, fruit or leaves to rub inside their diving mask instead of their saliva (hāʻae, spit) to prevent fogging.Use Outside of the Hawaiian Islands:Used medically elsewhere. The leaves can be cooked as greens. The wood is fashioned as pegs for boat building. [9]In Malaysia, the pith is used for making \"rice paper.\" [9]",

Though rushes and sedge belong to the same family (Cyperaceae), there is a simple way to distinguish one from another: the stem-like leaves (culms). Rushes have round, cylindrical stems or leaves, sometimes hollow like a drinking straw if cut open. Sedges have triangular, often sharp-edged leaves. Just remember: \"rushes are round; sedges have edges.\"Kaluhā somewhat resembles makaloa (Cyperus laevigatus), especially when the seed head (perianth) is in the younger stages. But plants are readily distinguished by the overall larger size of seed head and the accompanying bristles.This genus name for this sedge has recently changed. [1]",

The prostrate forms can be used as groundcovers, shrub forms as accent or hedges, and tree forms as accent, tall hedge or screen plants.Tree or tall bush forms with top heavy growth may need to be staked to prevent toppling over due to the wind, especially if grown in softer (i.e. loamy, sandy) soils. Too much water and fertilizer, especially with additional nitrogen, may be the culprits for luxuriant growth and fewer flowers. [David Eickhoff, Native Plants Hawaiʻi]Shrub and prostrate forms do well in pots with excellent or perfect drainage and with full sun. Allow potting mix to dry between waterings. Black sooty mold on trunk, twigs and leaves are indications of excessive watering. This needs to be corrected or it will likely lead to pests (e.g. root mealybugs, nematodes) and root rot. Drenchings with sea (salt) water help to alleviate some pest problems.* But quite frankly, if you are one that cannot keep your hands off the water hose, this may not be a good plant for you.Because ʻohai are nitrogen-fixing plants, they will not only provide a natural source of nitrogen for themselves but will enrich the soil with nitrogen benefiting other plants growing around them as well.Companion Plants:Coastal ʻohai do well with a number of dry or coastals natives such as ʻiliahialoʻe, ʻilima, naio, ʻakoko, kāwelu, low (prostrate) forms of naupaka kahakai and other low to medium height shrubs.+_____* See section \"Fertilizer\" under \"Growth Requirements\" below.+ These plants can be found on this website using the \"Browse Plants\" feature found at the top.

[7]In the Northwest Islands ʻohai is found on Necker (Mokumanamana) and is a rather common component in the shrubland on Nīhoa (Moku Manu)._____* ʻOhai was recently rediscovered on Kāohikaipua after last seen in 1937. [7]",
        "General Information": "ʻOhai (Sesbania tomentosa) is an endemic member of the Pea family (Fabaceae).ʻOhai is also the name for the non-native monkeypod or rain tree (Samaneasaman), and the white monkeypod (Albizia lebbecki). The name is also used in part for other plants such as, the large white edible flowers of ʻohai keʻokeʻo or katuray (Sesbania grandiflora), and the red-flowered form ʻohai ʻulaʻula (S. grandifloravar.coccinea); ʻohai ʻula or royal poinciana (Delonix reginia); and ʻohai aliʻi or Pride of Barbados (Caesalpinia pulcherrima).",
        "Etymology": "The generic nameSesbaniais derived fromsesban, the Arabic name forSesbania sesban(synS. aegyptiaca), Egyptian rattlepod.The specific epithettomentosameans \"furry\" or literally \"covered with matted hairs,\" though not all forms are furry.Hawaiian Names:Some reference sources spell the Hawaiian name ofSesbania tomentosawith the macron kahakō over the \"o\" asʻōhai; others do not. TheNative Plants Hawaiʻiknowledgebase  chooses to follow Pukui & Elbert's spelling with no kahakō asʻohai. [4]Pūʻohaiis a tree or shrub formʻohai. [3]",
        "Background Information": "The common, or vernacular, name Oʻahu riverhemp is admittedly an  unusual and odd name for this species. Local people know it as ʻOhai. But those  outside of Hawaiʻi nei may recognize the common name Oʻahu riverhemp. [6]An arborescent, or tree, form is found in central Molokaʻi and is the  woodiest of the numerous forms of ʻohai, growing to 20 feet tall. [1]There has been some mild controversy about how long ʻohai actually live. Some put it at an estimate of 5 to 7 years or even less; others have cultivated plants in excess of these years. Some ʻohai at Kaʻena Point, Oʻahu, for example, have been inexistence for well over decade or more. [David Eickhoff, Native Plants Hawaiʻi]",
        "Early Hawaiian Use": "ʻOhai were one of the favored lei flowers by early Hawaiians. [5]Early Hawaiians on Niʻihau called this plant ʻohai o Papiahuli, the  meaning is unknown. [2]",
        "Modern Use": "ʻOhai are still used today in lei and strung much like other native pea-like flowers, such as ʻāwikiwiki, māmane, nanea, nuku ʻiʻiwi, and wiliwili. [5]",

[6,12]Food (Cooking):ʻIlima kū kala along with other  plant materials were placed over hot stones in the imu. The food to be  cooked was then placed on the ʻilima to prevent it from being burned by  the heated stones. [4]Lei:ʻIlima may have been the only plant cultivated by early Hawaiians just for the flowers to be used for lei. [1] Lei ʻilima pua were treasured by early Hawaiians and given specific names based on their flowers, as well as leaves. (See above \"Additional Flower Color Information,\" \"Additional Plant Texture Information\" and \"Etymology\").Lei ʻilima were fashioned for the head (lei poʻo) or the neck (lei ʻāʻī), with the latter comprising a thousand flowers! [4]Originally, lei ʻilima, or the royal lei, was reserved for royalty since they looked very much like the yellow feather lei worn only by aliʻi. [5]Medicinal:ʻIlima was called kanaka makaʻi, literally meaning \"good man.\" [6] Early Hawaiians gave babies the juice of the flowers (pua ʻilima) as a mild laxative but apparently does not have an effect on adults. The number of buds were used was according to the age of the child. The buds were chewed by the mother before given to her baby. [4,6,8,14]Wild ʻilima sap with warm sea water was used medicinally as enemas (hahano) for adults. [4] ʻIlima flowers mixed with other plants were also used for \"womb troubles.\" When a person felt weak, the bark of the roots were mixed with other plants and pounded together, strained and drunk as a tonic. Additionally, the root bark mixed with the flowers was used for asthma. [8]",
        "Modern Use": "Queen Emma Kalanikaumakaamano Kaleleonālani Naʻea Rooke (1836-1885)  enjoyed lei ʻilima over all other lei. [9]Flowers often used for modern lei making in combination with materials or just as one prized lei. Laurie Shimizu Ide states that it takes \"about 700 blossoms for a single lei, kui pololei, straight pattern.\" [3] Though lei ʻilima was associated with royalty at one time, today anyone can wear this very special and beautiful lei. [5] When lei ʻilima is seen on the wearer, its striking beauty certainly commands attention! Fruits of the non-native maʻo (Abutilon grandifolium), when green and soft, are used  with lei ʻilima, one fruit at each end of the lei; or the pale-green,  cap-like calyx of the ʻilima flower is used. [14]Flowers are edible and can be used as a garnish with food. [Rick Barboza, Hui Kū Maoli Ola] The flavor is mildly sweet to tasteless but with a refreshing, clean after taste. [David Eickhoff, Native Plants Hawaiʻi]The mele (song) \"Aloha Oʻahu\" by Clarence Kinney opening verse speaks of the beautiful  ʻōʻō, a native bird with black, white and yellow feathers:\"Aloha Oʻahu lei ka ʻilima Kohu manu ʻōʻō hulu melemele.\"Translated:\"Beloved is Oʻahu with the ʻilima lei  Like the ʻōʻō it's golden plumage.\"[10]ʻIlima is still found in the Hawaiian coastal lowlands and up into the forests. Sadly, though, the Oʻahu ʻōʻō (Moho apicalis) and it's relatives, the Hawaiian honeyeaters, are now all extinct.",

        "General Information": "Keahi (Sideroxylon polynesicum) belongs to the Sapodilla family (Sapotaceae). There about 70 species of Sideroxylon, a number them particularly in the Caribbean Region, are considered as Vulnerable to Critically Endangered by The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).The indigenous keahi, and its endemic relative ʻālaʻa (Planchonella sandwicensis), are the only two in this family native to the Hawaiian Islands.Some edible family members include Sapodilla or Sapota (Manilkara zapota); the natural, original chewing Gum chicle (Manilkara chicle); Star apple (Chrysophyllum cainito); Mamey sapote or Abricó (Pouteria sapota); Canistel (Pouteriacampechiana); and the incredible Miracle fruit (Synsepalum dulcificum), which when eaten alters the tongues taste receptors turning bitter or sour foods, such as lemons and limes, sweet!One truly notable realtive of Keahi is Tambalacoque or Dodo tree (Sideroxylon grandiflorum), endemic to Mauritius. The Dodo, which became extinct in the 17th century, ate Tambalacoque fruits, and it was once thought that only by passing through the digestive tract of the Dodo could the seeds germinate. However, new evidence proves otherwise. [continue]",

Other  kin containing toxic chemicals are mandrake (Mandragora officinarum), Jimsonweed (Datura stramonium), and tobacco (Nicotianaspp.). But the \"Queen of Toxins,\" and one of our planets deadliest, is Belladonna (Atropa belladonna), which possess tropane alkaloids.

        "Etymology": "The Latin generic nameSolanumis derived fromsolororsolatus, comforter, for some plants in this genus that were used medically, specificallyS. nigrum, once used to treat epilepsy.The Latin specific epithetamericanum, from the Americas or American, refers to the fact that this species orginated in the Americas, the New World, but now is widely distributed in the tropics and warm areas.Hawaiian Names:Besides the above names, all four native species share the Hawaiian namepōpolo, which refers to the plant itself.Pōpolohuais a Niʻihau name for this plant.",
        "Background Information": "Pōpolo (Solanum americanum) is considered to be  either indigenous or an early Polynesian introduction to the Hawaiian  Archipelago. Seeds have been found in archaeological sites such as the  Mauna Kea Adze Quarry complex (pre-European contact) dating to about 1650, more than a century before Captain James Cook's arrival. [6]",
        "Early Hawaiian Use": "Pōpolo was one of the most important herbs for early Hawaiians. [6]Dye:A blackish purple dye was made from the fruits. [1]Food:The fruits, called pūʻili or ʻolohua, were enjoyed by early Hawaiians much as they are today. Tender shoots and leaves, which made excellent greens (spinach), were wrapped in or tied onto ti leaves, steamed in an ʻimu and eaten in times of food scarcity by early Hawaiians. Sometimes the leaves were cooked with pork, fish or wild birds. [1,5]Medicinal:The flowers and ripe fruit were chewed by the mother and fed to their baby internally, while the leaves were chewed to soften and put in a soft piece of cloth. The juice was squeezed into the hand and applied to the baby's body from head to feet to strengthen the child or to treat the childhood disease ʻea (thrush). [2,7] The juice of the berries was also taken as a laxative. [7]Juice from the bruised leaves were applied to sore tendons, muscles, and joints as well as for sprains and open wounds. [6,7] Bruised leaves rolled into a ball were rubbed on ʻōpū (stomach) as a cure for indigestion. [7]The juice from leaves and ripe berries used alone or in combination with each were used for all disorders of the respiratory tract, for skin eruptions, and when mixed with salt, a healing agent for cuts and wounds. [6]The young leaves were used medicinally for coughs and sore throats, either eaten raw or roasted in ti (kī) leaves over charcoal. [7]",
        "Modern Use": "The fruits and leaves are still used in modern times and usually enjoyed fresh.The leaves can be applied as a topical for bites and stings. [4]",

        "General Information": "Pōpolo (Solanum nelsonii) is a member of Solanaceae or the Nightshade family.There are four species ofSolanumnative to the Hawaiian Achipelago: one questionably indigenous species, glossy nightshade (S. americanum), with juicy edible fruits; and three endemics, pōpolo kū mai (S. incompletum), pōpolo (S. nelsonii), and pōpolo ʻaiakeakua (S. sandwicense), all of which do not have edible fruits.Other native members of the Nighshade family include and the indigenous ʻōhelo kai (Lycium sandwicense) and four species of ʻaiea in the endemic genusNothocestrum.Some edible family favorites are tomato,  potato, eggplant, cape  gooseberry or pohā, tomatillo, and green and  chile peppers.However, as the family name implies, this group also has some of the deadliest of all plants with sinister names as Apple of Sodom, Angel's trumpet, Porcupine tomato, Thorn apple, Devil's fig, Devil's apple, and Five-Minute plant. Other kin containing toxic chemicals are mandrake (Mandragora officinarum), Jimsonweed (Datura stramonium), and tobacco (Nicotianaspp.). But the \"Queen of Toxins,\" and one of our planets deadliest, is Belladonna (Atropa belladonna), which possess tropane alkaloids.

        "General Information": "Māmane (Sophora chrysophylla) is a member of the Pea or Legume family (Fabaceae). There are about 50 species in the genusSophora, with māmane as the sole representative in the Hawaiian Islands.Some interesting kin in the genus are eight yellow-flowered species from New Zealand known as Kōwhai (Māori for yellow); the fascinating Yellow necklace pod (Sophora tomentosa) with constricted round seed pods; Ku-Shen (S. flavescens), a Chinese medicinal herb; and Toromiro (S. toromiro), the last of the endemic trees from Rapa Nui (Easter Island) that was barely saved from extinction.",
        "Etymology": "The generic nameSophorais derived from the Arabic name for some papilionaceous (papilio, butterfly) tree, in reference to the pea-shaped flowers resembling a butterfly.The specific epithetchrysophyllais derived from the Greekchryso, golden, andphyllum, leaves.Hawaiian Names:The nameMamanois used by one source. [12] However, Pukui & Elbert have no reference for the name for this species. [13]",
        "Background Information": "Māmane leaf buds, flowers, and especially the green seed pods, are a main food source for the palila (Loxiodes balleui), an endangered honeycreeper now restricted to the māmane/naio forests of Mauna Kea, Hawaiʻi Island. The palila formerly had a much larger range on Hawaiʻi Island, south to the e. slope of Hualālai and n.w. slope of Mauna Loa. Fossil records indicate that it also once inhabited the dry lowland forests of Oʻahu (Barber's Point) and Kauaʻi. [9] Incidentally, māmane is/was also recorded at living nearly at sea level just above 100 ft. [10,11,12]Additionally, the yellow and green coloration of these birds may have served as camouflague among the trees, protecting them in pre-historic times from predators such as the Wood harrier (Circus dossenus) and the stilt-owls (Grallistrixspp.), and possibly from a hawk (Buteosp.) on Oʻahu--all now extinct. Perched among the branches palila are nearly indistinguishable among the bright yellow māmane flowers and grayish green seed pods and leaves. [8]Māmane is fire tolerant and often after burns seedlings can be seen sprouting. They cannot however tolerate feral goats and sheep feeding upon them. [7]",
        "Early Hawaiian Use": "Games & Sports:Usually māmane, or sometimes uhiuhi, wood was used for sled  runners in a sport for the aristocrats called hōlua. The slopes, or sledding track, called kahua hōlua  were usually made with layers of grass or ti leaves. [6,15]The papa hōlua, the sled used for this sport, was made of two narrow runners and were 7 to 12 or 18 feet long, 2 or 3 inches deep, rounded on the bottom, and highly polished. The front end tapered off and turned upward so as not to dig into the soil. The two runners were fastened together by a number of short pieces of wood laid horizontally across and lashed to the runners with cordage. Matting on the platform was lashed to the crossbars separating the runners. [15]Notes the Huliheʻe Palace website: \"The person  about to slide gripped the sled by the right hand grip, ran a few yard  to the starting place, grasped the other hand grip with the left hand,  threw himself forward with all his strength, fell flat on the sled and  slid down the hill. His hands held the handgrips and the feet were  braced against the last cross piece on the rear portion of the sled. The  sport was extremely dangerous as the sleds attained high speed running  down hill. Much skill was necessary to keep an even balance and to keep  from running off the slide or overturning the sled. In competitions, the  sled that went the farthest, won.\" [16]House Construction:The strong wood was used for posts, rafters and thatching posts or purlins in house (hale) construction. [5,6]Lei:The bright yellow flowers were used in lei making. [1,3,4]Medicinal:Māmane flowers were used as astringent. [15]Other Uses:The wood was fashioned into scraping board for olonā, adze handles, and farm spades. [5,6,15] It was also used as a superior fire wood. [6]",
        "Modern Use": "Years ago the hard, durable wood was used in fences. [5]The seeds can be strung on a beautiful permanent lei and flowers as temporary lei.Soaked seeds produce a bright yellow to amber colored water and possibly could be used to make a yellow dye.Wood is still used today to smoke meat.

[8]Lei:Lei makers used the lacy fronds to make fine-textured lei haku and for other   lei material providing a soft and comfortable base for   wearers. [3,7,8]Medicinal:Palaʻā was also used as a medicine for various female disorders. [5,8] The plant is boiled as a tea and drunk. It was also used to bathe in for puʻupuʻu ʻōhune (lump skin rash) or puʻu nunui (large or many bumps), and to wash pūhō (abscess, burst sore, ulcer), pehu (swelling), and pala (gonorrhea). [4]",
        "Modern Use": "Palaʻā is still used in lei work today. The fronds are interlaced with maile, ʻōhiʻa lehua, kuluʻī, wāwaeʻiole, and other native plants in lei for neck, head, wrist, ankle, and horse. [6]The fronds can also be used as greenery is a vase with a life of about 5 days. [6]",

        "General Information": "ʻŌhiʻa ha (Syzygium sandwicense) belong to the Myrtle family or Myrtaceae with a current figure at over 5,650 species. [2] The genusSyzygiumcomprises about 1100 species, with some very closely related edible notables such as clove (S. aromatica), jambulan or Java plum (S. cumini), rose apple (S. jambos), and Malay or mountain apple or ʻohiʻa ʻai (S. malaccense).Other non-native relatives, many naturalized in  Hawaiʻi, are numerous  and include myrtle, tea tree, strawberry  guava or waiawī ʻulaʻula,  pineapple guava or kuawa, allspice,  eucalyptus, melaleuca or paper  bark,  bottlebrush (Callistemon), and Surinam  cherry (Eugenia uniflora)--to  name a  few. Some of these have become  seriously invasives displacing  large tracts of native forests with a  monoscape of a single species. An  extreme example of this is the highly  invasive strawberry guava (Psidium cattleianum) where little vegetation can grow beneath its dense canopy.The native Myrtaceae members include the indigenous Beach cherry or nīoi (Eugenia reinwardtiana), and the endemics: five species of ʻōhiʻa (Metrosiderosspp.) and the endangered Koʻolau eugenia or nīoi (Eugenia koolauensis).",
        "Etymology": "The generic nameSyzygiumis from the Greek prefixsyn- orsys-, together, andzygon, yoked, in reference to the coherent (sticking together) petals that form a calyptra (hood or cup) in some species.The species namesandwicenserefers to the \"Sandwich Islands,\" as the Hawaiian Islands were once called, and named by James Cook on one of his voyages in the 1770s. James Cook named the islands after John Montagu (The fourth Earl of Sandwich) for supporting Cook's voyages.Hawaiian Names:PāʻihiandPāʻihiʻihiare Maui names for this tree.",

        "Early Hawaiian Use": "Dye:The bark produce a black dye for kapa (tapa). [5,8]House Construction:The wood was used in canoe construction, for fuel and house construction. [5,6]Medicinal:Apparently before Western contact, the leaves were brewed as a tea to lift the spirits. [7]",

        "General Information": "Milo is a member of the Mallow family or Malvaceae. There are eighteen species in the genusThespesiabut perhaps the best known and widely distributed one is the pantropic portia or milo (Thespesia populnea).",
        "Etymology": "The generic nameThespesiais derived from the Greekthespesios, divine, referring toT. populnea, which was collected in Tahiti by Captain Cook's expedition in 1769 and was reported to be a sacred tree and planted around places of worship.The specific epithetpopulnea, poplar-like, likely in reference to the leaves resembling some poplar (Populusspp.) tree species.Hawaiian Name:Milomeans to twist, curl, or spin. This name is also used in the Marshall Islands and American Samoa. [15]",
        "Background Information": "This is probably an indigenous tree. However, to date, there is no conclusive evidence to support milo as indigenous. [6,12,14] Even so, milo is also one of the canoe plants that the Polynesians brought with them to the islands, and certainly not invasive as its non-native cousin hau (Hibiscus tiliaceus), also brought in by the early settlers.The fruits and seeds are salt tolerant and are distributed island to island by sea. The seeds will germinate even after a year in seawater. [15]Even though the flowers and young leaves are reported to be mildly poisoness, [15] milo is one of the few plants that were listed as an emergency food during World War II in a manual called “Emergency Food Plants and Poisonous Plants of the Islands of the Pacific” by the War Department. It states that “the purpose of this manual is to aid the individual who becomes separated from his unit…so that this individual can live off the land.” It then briefly identifies the plant and how to prepare it. [8]",
        "Early Hawaiian Use": "Milo was popular as a shade tree among the early Hawaiians, but had many practical uses as well. [16]Cordage:The inner bark was used for its fiber as such and for corage, but was somewhat inferior to hau for these purposes. [16]Dye:The fruits produce a yellowish green dye. [3,9,16]Food:Early Hawaiians found young milo leaves, flowers, and flower buds to be edible. [5,9,10,15,16]House Furnishings:The beautiful wood was prized by early Hawaiians, second only to kou, to make food bowls (ʻumeke milo), poi calabashes, platters (pā milo), and dishes because the wood gave no unpleasant taste to the food like some other native woods, such as koa. [1,3,5,10,14,15]Lei:The yellow flowers were used by lei makers. [7]Royalty:Milo was considered a sacred tree and the use prohibited by commoners. [4] The house of King Kamehameha I in Waikīkī was surrounded by milo. [9,16]Other Uses:The bark was used as cordage. [3,9] Milo also produced medicine, oil, and gum from plant parts. [3,9,16]",
        "Modern Use": "Today, the seeds are sometimes strung for permanent lei. [2]The dark heartwood is moderately heavy, durable, and easy to work with. The wood has low shrinkage rate when drying [15] and has been fashioned into beautiful items such as carvings, bowls and platters. [11,12,13] Milo is also used in boat building and in cabinet making. [15]In Hawaiʻi and elsewhere in the tropics, milo is sometimes used as street or park trees, or as a living fence. [15]UsesOutside of Hawaiʻi:In the West Indies, where cotton is an important crop, this naturalized species is eradicated because it is a host of the cotton stainer (Dysdercussp.), a red insect that stains fibers of growing cotton. [15]Thespecia garckeanafrom East Africa has edible fruits.The fibers ofThespecialampasfrom Africa to the Philippines is like sunn or sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea), which is more durable than jute.

        "General Information": "Nohu (Tribulus cistoides) is the sole native Hawaiian member of the Creosote bush family (Zygophyllaceae).",
        "Etymology": "The generic nameTribuluscomes from the Greek word for caltrop,tribolos, a ghastly 4-pointed metal antipersonnel weapon, with one point always pointing upwards to cripple human troops, horses, camels or elephants in warfare.The specific epithetcistoidesalludes the flowers similarity to the genusCistus, also called rockrose or labdanum.Hawaiian Name:Nohuis also the name of scorpionfishes (Scorpaenopsis cacopsis and other scorpaenids) with poisonous spines. (SeeDid You Know...?near the top of this page.",
        "Background Information": "The ecological importance ofTribulus cistoidesis noted by the following: \"In 1896, nohu occurred 'almost everywhere on the island, especially in sandy areas between the single Eragrostis bunches' (Schauinsland 1899). This quote suggests that at the turn of the century, nohu was somewhat more common on Laysan than it is currently. It was one of the few plants to survive the devegetation by rabbits...Its relatively large, spiney seeds probably aided in its ability to withstand the rabbits' grazing. Also, as the Laysan Finch population fell during the island's devegetated stage, finch predation on nohu and other seeds may have decreased, allowing a seed bank to remain. Laysan Ducks have been reported to forage under nohu, and the now extinct Laysan Honeycreeper got nectar from it (Munro 1960).\" [2]The Laysan finch (Telespiza cantans) feed on nohu seeds, leaves, flowers, runners, and seedlings as a minor part of their diet. [2,3]However, the 1967 experimental introduction of Laysan finches to Pearl and Hermes Reef used nohu as amajorpart of their diet. [3] It should be noted that there were fifteen native species to the islands of Pearl and Hermes Reef, only of which one is now extinct (Achyrathes atollensis).An important natural habitat of nohu, pōhuehue (Ipomoea pes-caprae), and alena (Boerhavia repens) currently exists on Laysan. [2]",
        "Early Hawaiian Use": "Medicinally, the leaves and roots of nohu were pounded and used for ʻaʻai (sores, ulcers) and pūhō (abscess, burst sores). [1]",
        "Modern Use": "Nohu has been generally viewed by many as a weed and to be eradicated.The spiny fruit ofnohucan be quite painful if stepped on barefoot. The spines will even puncture rubber slippers. Thus, modern views ofnohuare often negative, resulting in beaches and other porpulated locations being totally  cleared of this native plant.

Other well known members include heath (Erica), heather (Calluna), mayflower (Epigaea repens), madrone (Arbutus), mazanita (Arctostaphylos),Azalea,Rhododendron, and the wonderfully fragrant wintergreen (Gaultheria procombens).The only other native relative is pūkiawe (Leptecophylla tameiameiae) which is also found in the Marquesas Islands.",
        "Etymology": "The generic nameVacciniumis from the Latinvaccinus, of cows, in reference to the German folk-name kuhteke. Kuh is cow in German.Th specific epithetcalycinumcomes from the Latin for 'with a conpicuous calyx,' in reference to the more prominent calyxes (leafy portion under the flower) than the other species.",
        "Background Information": "ʻŌhelo kau lāʻau is the largest and tallest of the three native ʻōhelo (Vacciniumspp.) growing to over fifteen feet tall and at least six feet wide. It is also the most distinctive and easily recogizedVacciniumspecies in Hawaiʻi.They may be an important seasonal component in the diet of ʻōmaʻo or Hawaiian thrush (Myadestes obscurus). [7]NOTE:  All species of ʻōhelo have edible berries. An unrelated native plant ʻākia (Wikstroemiaspp.) often grows in the same habit as ʻōhelo and both have red  berries. But to the untrained eye the two can be mistaken for the same  plant. While ʻōhelo berries are edible, ʻākia berriesare notand  some species are even reported to be poisonous! For good reason, then,  ʻākia are known by the common name \"false ohelo.\" The differences  between the plants are easy once you take time to learn them. Pleasetake the time to learn them.You can do so by visiting a number of plant profiles forWikstroemiaon this site.",
        "Early Hawaiian Use": "Though all three native species are known by the  Hawaiian name ʻōhelo, distinctive names were given for two of them:  ʻōhelo ʻai (V. reticulatum) literally \"edible ʻōhelo\" known for its delicious berries; and ʻōhelo kau lāʻau (V. calycinum), meaning \"to put [placed] on trees,\" perhaps referring to the plants nature of occasionally growing in trees (ephiphytic).The early Hawaiians enjoyed eating the berries much as we do today. The fruit was not readily available as everyday food since they grew high in the mountains. But like hikers today, they were considered wild food and eaten when found ripe. [5,6]Medicinally, the  leaf buds, leaves and fruit were combined with other plant material for  abdonimal pains. The ingredients were pounded together into a mash and  strained through the leaves of ʻahuʻawa (Cyperus javanicus), and drunk in the morning and evening. [3,7]New leaves (liko), fruit (berries) and flowers were in used lei making. [3,4,6]ʻŌhelo and Pele:ʻŌhelo  was considered a sacred plant by the early Hawaiians. No one was to eat  any berries without first offering them to Pele, the goddess of fire,  lightening, dance, volcanoes, and violence. With branches of ʻōhelo  berries in hand, they would say:\"E Pele, eia  ka ʻōhelo 'au; e taumaha aku wau ʻia ʻoe, e ʻai hoʻi au tetahi.\" (O  Pele, here are your ʻōhelo [branches]; I offer some to you, some I also  eat.) Then, they would toss a portion of the branch with berries  attached into the crater as an offering to Pele. After which they were  allowed to eat some.In 1823, among the first  white people to visit Kīlauea was Reverend William Ellis and his  missonary entourage, accompanied by Hawaiians. On the journey, when the  missonaries became hungry they ate some ʻōhelo berries and were quickly  warned to give some to Pele first before partaking of them. Ellis wrote,  \"We told them ...that we acknowledged Jehovah  as the only divine  proprietor of the fruits of this  earth, and felt thankful to Him for  them, especially  in our present circumstances. We traveled on,   regretting that the natives should indulge in notions  so  superstitious.\" [1]Following the example of  Ellis, in December 1824, the High Chiefess Kapiʻolani (c.1741-1841) set  out on a mission from Kona to visit the still active Kīlauea where she  would dare Pele to do her worst, even though her husband and others  tried to dissaude her. She made the long journey of about one hundred  miles mostly by foot with a large company. There she was met by a  preistess of Pele threatening her with Pele's displeasure if she  continued with her hostile errand, and prophesied that she and her  followers would perish miserably. With defiance, she descended into the  crater, gathered ʻōhelo berries and ate them without first offering them  to Pele, and threw rocks into the crater to insult the goddess. She and  her eighty followers went to the edge of Halemaʻumaʻu caldera and  addressed her followers: \"Jehovah is my God. He kindled these fires. I  fear not Pele. If I persih by the anger of Pele, then you may fear the  power of Pele; but if I trust in Jehovah, and he should save me from the  wrath of Pele, when I break her tabus [taboos], then you must fear and  serve the Lord Jehovah. All the gods of Hawaii are vain!\" Then they sang  hymns. [1,2]There was no wrath from Pele.  Kapiʻolani and her followers did not succumb to any horrible death as  prophesized they surely would.",
        "Modern Use": "ʻŌhelo, in general, are perhaps the most popular native Hawaiian fruit. The berries are used today in making jams, jellies, pie filling or eaten fresh.ʻŌhelo kau lāʻau is probably the least used of the three native species, perhaps because of inaccessibility to good locations for harvesting. Modern roads to the two other higher elevation species has made them easily available and more useable. Too, the fruit of ʻōhelo kau lāʻau is tart, but sometimes added to other ʻōhelo species in jams and jellies. [7]",

        "Additional Habitat Information": "A rather common East Maui ʻākia found in dry shrublands on ʻaʻā lava and in pastures from 820 to about 4000 feet.",
        "General Information": "ʻĀkia belong to Daphne family (Thymelaeaceae). There are a dozen endemic species in the Hawaiian Islands.Wikstroemia monticolais a close relative ofW. uva-ursi. The main difference being thatW. monticolais always a small tree, whereasW. uva-ursiis a sprawling shrub.",
        "Etymology": "The genus is named for Johan Emanuel Wikström (1789-1856), a Swedish botanist and author of several papers on Thymelaeaceae.The specific epithetmonticolais from the Latinmontis, of mountains, andcola, living in or from, in reference to its mountain habitat.Hawaiian Names:Botanist William Hillebrand (1888) states the Hawaiian names for the  genus are \"akia\" or \"akea.\" Hillebrand (1888) also states the root of  the word may be in the Fijian name for the genusmatiand that the native name for the genus in Tahiti isovao. [3]The nameʻākiais also shared bySolanum nelsonii, a small native shrub in the Solanaceae or Nightshade family.ʻĀkiaalso means \"to ferment; very sour, as poi.ʻAi ʻākia, sour poi.\" [5] Any name realionship is uncertain.Distinctive varieties are namedlau nui,mānalo, andpehu. [5]Kauhiis an alternate name for this species.",
        "Background Information": "The common name \"false ohelo\" is attributed to the fact that the fruits of ʻākia resemble the orange or red ʻōhelo (Vacciniumspp.) berries.",
        "Early Hawaiian Use": "ʻĀkia bark was used as a source of fiber material for ropes. [2]Manual of the Flowering Plants of Hawaiʻi, B. Peterson (1990) states that “Species ofWikestroemiahave furnished one of the strongest Hawaiian fibers, used in making ropes and braids. It is also said to have been used in making kapa. Measurements made from fibers of branches desiccated for 6 months demonstrated that the density ofWikestroemiafibers was about the same as that of New Zealand flax (Phormium tenax) and ramie (Boehmeria nivea).\"The wood, likely from larger species, was used as ‘auamo (carrying sticks) and [6] also used as a type of ceremonial firewood in ʻanaʻana magic (Kamakau 1991). [3]Medicinally, the sap of ʻākia (Wikestroemiaspp.) mixed with niu (coconut) and kō kea (white sugarcane) was taken internally with ‘uala (sweet potato) as a purgative. The leaves and leaf buds were mixed with the bark of ‘ōhi‘a ‘ai (Syzygium malaccense) and ‘uhaloa root (Waltheria indica), niu, kō ‘aina kea (a sugarcane variety). Plant material was pounded, water added, strained, and the liquid taken internally for wai‘ōpua pa‘a (leukorrhea) and nae kūlou (shortness of breath?). [6]Roots,  bark, leaves and stems were used as a poison to stupefy fish called hola which were  then gathered by the early Hawaiians. The plant parts were crushed,  placed in a porous container, and sunk in salt water pools. The fish  were safe to eat because ʻākia is not known to be poisonous to  warm-blooded creatures by means of this fishing method. [2]So is ʻĀkia Poisonous or Not?Alkaloids can be extracted from various parts of the plants, and ʻākia has an old reputation for being poisonous. Reputable sources mention that ʻākia was used in old Hawaiʻi as a death penalty  for those who broke kapu. The guilty party was forced to drink the  juice of ʻākia, causing seizure and death. [1,4]  Botanist Otto Degener (1945) mentions that criminals were executed by means of a deadly drink prepared from roots and bark of ʻākia together with parts of other plants. However, another reputable reference says that 'no parts of ʻākia are poisonous to mammals,'  likely including humans. [2] However, it is possible thatnot allspecies ofWikestroemiaare poisonous, judging by experiments where ʻākia has been shown to be nontoxic. Handy and Handy (1972:239) distinguished two types of ʻākia: a bitter ʻākia  (ʻākia ʻawa) and a ‘mild’ ʻākia  (ʻākia  manalo). The bitter ʻākia  is described as a shrub that bears orange-red fruits, a description that matches that of most HawaiianWikestroemiaspecies. Of this type they write that decoctions of the bark and roots are deadly poisonous and were used for killing and suicide. The other mild type of ʻākia, of which no description is given, is described as not being poisonous but rather whose bark and leaves were used as a narcotic. [3]Either way, it is probably best to side with caution and avoid ingesting any parts of ʻākia until sound information is available.",

        "Etymology": "The genus is named for Johan Emanuel Wikström (1789-1856), a Swedish botanist and author of several papers on Thymelaeaceae.The specific epithetphillyreifoliais derived from the LatinPhillyrea, a genus in the Olive family (Oleaceae), andfolius, leaves, referring to the leaves resemblingPhillyreaspp.Hawaiian Names:Botanist William Hillebrand (1888) states the Hawaiian names for the  genus are \"akia\" or \"akea.\" Hillebrand (1888) also states the root of  the word may be in the Fijian name for the genusmatiand that the native name for the genus in Tahiti isovao. [5]The nameʻākiais also shared bySolanum nelsonii, a small native shrub in the Solanaceae or Nightshade family.ʻĀkiaalso means \"to ferment; very sour, as poi.ʻAi ʻākia, sour poi.\" [4] Any name realionship is uncertain.Distinctive varieties are namedlau nui,mānalo, andpehu. [4]Kauhiis an alternate name for this species.",
        "Background Information": "Wikstroemia phillyreifoliais very closely allied toW. pulcherrima.",
        "Early Hawaiian Use": "ʻĀkia bark was used as a source of fiber material for ropes. [2]Manual of the Flowering Plants of Hawaiʻi, B. Peterson (1990) states that “Species ofWikestroemiahave furnished one of the strongest Hawaiian fibers, used in making  ropes and braids. It is also said to have been used in making kapa.  Measurements made from fibers of branches desiccated for 6 months  demonstrated that the density ofWikestroemiafibers was about the same as that of New Zealand flax (Phormium tenax) and ramie (Boehmeria nivea).\"The wood, likely from larger species, was used  as ‘auamo (carrying sticks) and [6] also used as a type of ceremonial  firewood in ʻanaʻana magic (Kamakau 1991). [5]Medicinally, the sap of ʻākia (Wikestroemiaspp.) mixed with niu (coconut) and kō kea (white sugarcane) was taken  internally with ‘uala (sweet potato) as a purgative. The leaves and leaf  buds were mixed with the bark of ‘ōhi‘a ‘ai (Syzygium malaccense) and ‘uhaloa root (Waltheria indica),  niu, kō ‘aina kea (a sugarcane variety). Plant material was pounded,  water added, strained, and the liquid taken internally for wai‘ōpua pa‘a  (leukorrhea) and nae kūlou (shortness of breath?). [6]Roots,  bark, leaves and stems were used as a  poison to stupefy fish called hola which were  then gathered by the  early Hawaiians. The plant parts were crushed,  placed in a porous  container, and sunk in salt water pools. The fish  were safe to eat  because ʻākia is not known to be poisonous to  warm-blooded creatures by  means of this fishing method. [2]So is ʻĀkia Poisonous or Not?Alkaloids can be extracted from various parts of  the plants, and ʻākia has an old reputation for being poisonous.  Reputable sources mention that ʻākia was used in old Hawaiʻi as a death  penalty  for those who broke kapu. The guilty party was forced to drink  the  juice of ʻākia, causing seizure and death. [1,3]  Botanist Otto  Degener (1945) mentions that criminals were executed by means of a  deadly drink prepared from roots and bark of ʻākia together with parts  of other plants. However, another reputable reference says that 'no  parts of ʻākia are poisonous to mammals,'  likely including humans. [2]  However, it is possible thatnot allspecies ofWikestroemiaare poisonous, judging by experiments where ʻākia has been shown to be  nontoxic. Handy and Handy (1972:239) distinguished two types of ʻākia: a  bitter ʻākia  (ʻākia ʻawa) and a ‘mild’ ʻākia  (ʻākia  manalo). The  bitter ʻākia  is described as a shrub that bears orange-red fruits, a  description that matches that of most HawaiianWikestroemiaspecies. Of this type they write that decoctions of the bark and roots  are deadly poisonous and were used for killing and suicide. The other  mild type of ʻākia, of which no description is given, is described as  not being poisonous but rather whose bark and leaves were used as a  narcotic. [5]Either way, it is probably best to  side with caution and avoid ingesting any parts of ʻākia until sound  information is available.",

        "Background Information": "Some who have read the book or seen the recent animation movie, like to call this plant the Lorax tree, after Dr. Seuss' \"The Lorax.\"This impressive species does well in lowland gardens growing to over 16 feet tall topped with a rossette of leaves. Unlike some Asteraceae relatives that are annual or perennial bloomers, iliau blooms once after several years of growth, flowers, sets its seed, and then dies. [4]Though iliau closely related to naʻenaʻe (Dubautiaspp.) no natural intergenetic hybrids have been found, unlike the silversword with more than thirty crosses betweenDubautiaandArgyroxiphium. [4]There's an old saying that goes:ʻO ka iliau loho i ka lā, pūʻolo hau kakahiaka; The iliau plant drooping by day, the carrier of morning dew.[5]Dwarf iliauAn extremely rare relative, also endemic to Kauaʻi, known as the Dwarf iliau (Wilkesia hobdyi), is scientifically named after its discoverer and botanist Robert Hobdy, a resident of Maui. This small plant is restricted to a few very dry ridges in its native habitat and usually blooms usually later from September to October, or even in December. [1] The dwarf iliau is an overall smaller plant around two feet tall, but still with an impressive floral display. [4] This species is found from 900 to around 1300 feet in elevation.",
        "Early Hawaiian Use": "Otto Degener in \"Flora Hawaiiensis\" [3] says that \"Kauai Wilkesia ...is said to have been used medicinally by the ancient Hawaiians.\" Kaluna M. Kaʻaiakamanu confirms that iliau was used as medicine, but does not explain its application. [2]",
        "Modern Use": "Iliau can be seen in some botanical gardens. It does well in home landscapes with good sunlight and minimal water.",
