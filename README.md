# General Info

Pu’u’o Manoa (MAP) is a to-scale, interactive map of Pu’o’ Manoa or Rocky Hill. It aims to educate K-5 students on the geography of Pu’u’o Manoa, as well as native plants and animals residing there. 

## How it works:

A large to-scale map of Pu’u’o Manoa containing models of plants all across Pu’u’o Manoa, users are given a bird’s eye view of the map, where they can choose a place to put the marker. After placing down the marker, the user is free to explore Pu’u’o Manoa. To return to the bird’s eye view, press “K”. Controls are WASD. (W to move forward, A to move left, S to move back, and D to move right). 

Users will be able to interact with specific plants and animals to understand more about them, being given a description with a text bubble appearing on the screen.

# NEED TO KNOW:

When working on the project, do NOT work in the same scene at the same time, will cause merging issues. Create different scenes to work on props, code, etc.
