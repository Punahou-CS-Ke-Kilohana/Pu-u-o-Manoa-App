# General Info

Pu’u’o Manoa (MAP) is a to-scale, interactive map of Pu’o’ Manoa or Rocky Hill. It aims to educate K-5 students on the geography of Pu’u’o Manoa, as well as native plants and animals residing there. 

## How it works:

A large to-scale map of Pu’u’o Manoa containing models of plants all across Pu’u’o Manoa, users are given a bird’s eye view of the map, where they can choose a place to put the marker. After placing down the marker, the user is free to explore Pu’u’o Manoa. To return to the bird’s eye view, press “K”. Controls are WASD. (W to move forward, A to move left, S to move back, and D to move right). 

On mobile, drag the "Place Me!" block anywhere on the map you'd like the marker to begin at. Instead of the WASD keys, use the joystick on the left-hand side of the screen to move; the direction you move the joystick corresponds to the direction you move on the map. Use the joystick on the right-hand side of the screen to move the screen. To return back to the map, press the white "X" button in the top left-hand corner of the screen. 

Users will be able to interact with specific plants and animals to understand more about them, being given a description with a text bubble appearing on the screen.

## How it works: (AI)

From the home screen click on AI button to explore the various Native Hawaii Plants. Click on a specific plant to learn more about it. 

The camera button on the bottom right of the home screen is used to take a picture of a plant and the AI will redirect you to the plant it predicts you took a picture of. Note that because of the limited data that our AI is trained on, it may not be 100% accurate.

# NEED TO KNOW:

When working on the project, do NOT work in the same scene at the same time, will cause merging issues. Create different scenes to work on props, code, etc.
