# General Info

Pu’u’o Manoa (MAP) is a to-scale, interactive map of Pu’o’ Manoa or Rocky Hill. It aims to educate K-5 students on the geography of Pu’u’o Manoa, as well as native plants and animals residing there. 

## How it works:

A large to-scale map of Pu’u’o Manoa containing models of plants all across Pu’u’o Manoa, users are given a bird’s eye view of the map, where they can choose a place to put the marker. After placing down the marker, the user is free to explore Pu’u’o Manoa. To return to the bird’s eye view, press “K”. Controls are WASD. (W to move forward, A to move left, S to move back, and D to move right). 

On mobile, drag the "Place Me!" block anywhere on the map you'd like the marker to begin at. Instead of the WASD keys, use the joystick on the left-hand side of the screen to move; the direction you move the joystick corresponds to the direction you move on the map. Use the joystick on the right-hand side of the screen to move the screen. To return back to the map, press the white "X" button in the top left-hand corner of the screen. 

Users will be able to interact with specific plants and animals to understand more about them, being given a description with a text bubble appearing on the screen.

Map is primarily coded on Unity 2022.3.46f1 and C#. 

## Packages:

ProBuilder
		
FreeSportsKit_SA


## Complete:

Player Controls

Map Placement Marker

Props (Water Tank, Tennis Courts)

Joystick

Basic Terrain

## Needs to be worked on:
		
More plant/animal models

Making to-scale with a GPS tracker (ONLY DO AT END, IF TIME ALLOWS)

		
### Prioritize THIS:

Info for plants and animals 

Pavilion Prop


# NEED TO KNOW:

When working on the project, do NOT work in the same scene at the same time, will cause merging issues. Create different scenes to work on props, code, etc.
